1
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,070
What are they doing?

2
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,656
It's a game.

3
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,077
They stand with a big stick,

4
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,995
see how to lay the long cord,

5
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,332
and where to stand
the little sticks.

6
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,920
Why do they do it here?

7
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,897
Figure I must have
got off the stage road.

8
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,524
Don't see where though.

9
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,819
¿Habla Español?

10
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,072
I do not.

11
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:26,451
Well, that's good. I've got
very little Spanish myself.

12
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:30,247
This place be four,
five miles back,
as you sit now.

13
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,582
Oh. In that case,
I've passed it.

14
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,084
You rode right through it.

15
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,546
Well, it'd be no farther east.

16
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,297
I just said that it wasn't.

17
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,301
You can go back how you came.

18
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,680
And this time, when you get
to the river, you look.

19
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,474
And I will see a town
right there, huh?

20
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,726
And don't act like
it's some damn miracle neither.

21
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,521
All right.

22
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,441
Hey, brother, you eaten today?

23
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,402
Be gone with you now.
I'm not your brother.

24
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,850
James Sykes.

25
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:53,742
Get!

26
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,618
Get!

27
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,162
Come on. Come on. Go.

28
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:11,718
Get!

29
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,303
Come on!

30
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,306
Get up.

31
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,408
Where was he?

32
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,370
If he lives,
you can ask him all about it.

33
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,769
Caleb, go take Gratton
and find his horse.

34
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,397
Nah, I'm gonna run
that girl of his down.

35
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,357
Hey.

36
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,698
Joon, she knows.

37
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,830
All right. All right.
Get off me.

38
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,789
Huh?

39
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,881
But I will have
my breakfast first.

40
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,678
Hmm?

41
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,555
You ain't hitting
nobody no more.

42
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,102
Your brother told you
get that horse.

43
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,187
Go on!

44
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,439
Before something eats it.

45
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,066
Go on in. Tend to him.

46
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,199
That man who held himself moral

47
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,784
in years of plenty,

48
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,330
he will rise
in a different light.

49
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,834
He will take up
against his brothers...

50
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:53,379
and they will war
over the withering fruits
of the land.

51
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:07,972
Doesn't that look good, honey?

52
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,098
Yes, Momma.

53
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,949
Water'll will rise up
through soil. It does.

54
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,077
- Like oil through a wick.
- Mmm.

55
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,119
Joseph!

56
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,958
That's why you gotta
break the soil up

57
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,461
and let the water out...
for it to fall back as rain.

58
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,796
No. That's a...

59
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,299
That's a fallacy.

60
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:47,136
No, sir. Rain always
follows the plow, son.

61
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,221
But it doesn't.

62
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,389
It certainly does.

63
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,933
Rain follows the plow.

64
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,060
- Think they'll notice?
- Oh yeah.

65
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,439
Come on.
Your father's no good at this.

66
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:42,692
No.

67
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,570
Really, Nat? No?

68
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,904
No.

69
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,698
Mrs. Kittredge?

70
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,449
Thank you, Tom.

71
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,618
You see this? A gentleman.

72
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,337
Careful! It's loaded.

73
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,339
Careful!

74
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,758
Maybe you all
better watch out. Huh?

75
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:08,676
Hup! Hup! Hup!

76
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,012
Watch it!

77
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:14,974
Nat, they're going.

78
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,773
Nat? They said come on.

79
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,617
- That wasn't nice.
- Shut up.

80
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,037
What? Don't say that.

81
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,958
Nat! Don't talk like that.

82
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,682
Wasn't so bad, right?

83
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,435
You were dancing!
I saw you. Didn't I, Fran?

84
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,853
Well, I held Dr. Bowman up

85
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,230
till somebody
found him a chair.

86
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,482
If you can call that dancing.

87
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:07,985
You know, the one man I did ask
turned me right down.

88
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,321
Oh, it's true.
I could have cried.

89
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,615
Well, what fool
would turn you down?

90
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:16,077
I won't say, but he's
following you right now

91
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,662
with his rifle, James.

92
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,666
Wouldn't you dance
with your mother?

93
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,084
Won't dance with anybody.

94
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,544
Nat, you're
a wonderful dancer.

95
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,672
Boy looks an idiot
dancing with his mother.

96
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,675
I was dancing.

97
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,178
I danced, Daddy.

98
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,347
Yeah, you were
the belle of the ball.

99
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:52,965
Nat.

100
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,262
What?

101
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,648
Someone's in the yard.

102
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,818
Someone's in the yard.
Someone's in the...

103
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:16,947
Shh.

104
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,910
We're all right.

105
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,454
Lizzie?

106
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,874
Nat. It's okay.

107
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:27,917
We're all right.

108
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,795
Nat.

109
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,803
In the, uh... the cupboard.

110
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:41,180
Caps and shot for that one.

111
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,393
Nat. Right there, son.

112
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,319
Mom!

113
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,078
It's gonna be all right, honey.

114
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,163
I just want you
to stay down here low.

115
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,374
All right? Don't be afraid.

116
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,310
Get ahold of it! Look out!

117
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,651
No! No!

118
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,591
Please!

119
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,448
Come on. Come on.

120
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,375
- What are you doing?
- Jesus!

121
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,793
Get rid of that.

122
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,794
What?

123
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:41,008
Nah, I ain't sitting here
while they...

124
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,761
If you don't like it, Malcolm,
don't watch,

125
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,179
but you ain't giving us up
with this.

126
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,441
James! James!

127
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:43,028
James, it's Bill Landry
and a couple others.

128
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,869
All right. Careful.
Put him down easy.

129
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,246
Here we go. Bring him down.

130
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,540
Ma'am, you keep
any water up here?

131
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,833
We do. We...

132
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,543
Wet some rugs
and some blankets.

133
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,128
Make it quick,
your roof's about to go.

134
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,723
We can nail this shut
as soon as they're done

135
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,975
putting up the blankets
and our man comes down.

136
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,226
There's no one else coming?

137
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,147
There's no one else coming?

138
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,899
Oh, there's plenty.

139
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,526
Just none you want to let in.

140
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,281
No, no. You stay up.
You stay up. Come on.

141
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,366
Your boy's watching.

142
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,954
You just watch, son.
We'll get through this.

143
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,018
Oh, thank you.

144
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:22,980
Put them right here.

145
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,984
- Okay, there you go.
- Oops.

146
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,027
It's okay, honey.

147
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,529
- I can get it.
- It doesn't matter.

148
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,488
- No, I can get it. But...
- Just leave it, honey.

149
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,547
Get him off... me.

150
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:51,759
Get him off me!

151
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,475
Nat! Nat!

152
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,940
Hey! Fran, come here.
Get them out of here.

153
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,026
Now!

154
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,110
Nat, come here!

155
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,111
Nat!

156
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,738
Go, go, go!

157
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,038
Daddy?

158
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,499
Come on. Come on! Come on!

159
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,417
In there, now!

160
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,171
Get in there.

161
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,180
Thank you.

162
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,181
Here you go, Momma.

163
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,724
Okay, Nat, come. Nat.

164
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,017
- Nat.
- It's all right.

165
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,020
I'm gonna be with dad.

166
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,439
No. No. No! Nathaniel!

167
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,400
Nathaniel! No!

168
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,238
Momma?

169
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,507
Stay right behind me. Okay?

170
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,009
Come on.

171
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,515
Oh, God. Oh, God.

172
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,190
Oh, God.

173
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,526
- Momma? I can't breathe.
- Oh, God.

174
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:35,612
I can't breathe.

175
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,290
Stop. Stop.

176
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,499
Stop! It's gonna come down.

177
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:54,798
Okay, back up. Back up.

178
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,801
You have to trust me, honey.
Okay?

179
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:58,677
Okay.

180
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,833
Stop it. Stop.

181
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,102
Come on. Come on.

182
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,063
Come on.

183
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:25,931
Ma's got Lizzie.

184
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,143
I said I'd stay out here
with you.

185
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,417
I'm sorry.

186
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,797
I'm sorry I waved that gun
at Lizzie.

187
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:07,347
Good girl.

188
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,641
Breathe, baby. Breathe, baby.

189
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,228
Okay, my turn now, baby.

190
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,448
Well, I'll be god-damned.

191
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,200
Are they leaving?

192
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:30,912
Didn't think
they were that many.

193
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,218
You ready, son?

194
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,099
I think so, Daddy.

195
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,562
Now, I'm gonna turn
the light out, baby.

196
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,773
- No! No! No. Momma, please.
- Yes, you have to trust me.

197
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,858
Shh. You have to trust me.

198
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,319
You have to trust me.
You have to trust me.

199
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,051
God prepare us to table before me

200
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,303
in the presence of thy enemies.

201
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,598
Thou anoint us my head with oil...

202
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:34,309
my cup runneth over.

203
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,650
Close your eyes.

204
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,281
Rider coming in!

205
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,931
Everybody, hold.

206
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,475
You heard him. Hold!

207
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,980
All right, Sergeant,
fall them out.

208
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,357
Report back to me in an hour.

209
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:51,399
Yes, sir.

210
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,276
Fall out.

211
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,533
He's all right.

212
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,831
Mr. Chavez,
try looking out there.

213
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,920
God love the Apache boys

214
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,797
for leaving you
some honest work.

215
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:16,299
You two, up on that rise.
Let 'em have a look at ya.

216
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,593
The rest of you,
leave your firearms aboard.

217
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,804
You mightn't know one end
of a rifle from the other,

218
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:23,473
but you're all ye hell on
a spade as I ought to know.

219
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,183
Go on out there.
Let's start digging.

220
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,122
What is this?

221
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,792
Apache, sir.

222
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:53,002
Apt to have been
White Mountain.

223
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,045
I mean you.

224
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:56,464
What are you doing here?

225
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,718
It's where we live, sir.

226
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,555
No, it isn't.

227
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,016
You might have stopped here,
but that's it.

228
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,020
The only ones staying here
are them.

229
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:13,606
Sir?

230
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,702
You all the first settlement?

231
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:26,828
No, sir.

232
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:28,997
I take it they were.

233
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:36,796
Who's that?

234
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,050
Don't know.

235
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,052
Got here too late to ask.

236
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,930
Apaches might know
something about it.

237
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,891
You can ask them.

238
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:49,601
So that's what you found
when you got here?

239
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:50,727
Was those graves?

240
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:53,521
Yes, sir.

241
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,107
And you wouldn't take that
as some kind of sign?

242
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,235
Sure, we did.

243
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,945
Sign to build
on this side of the river.

244
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:05,450
How's that working out
for you?

245
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:17,670
If my father came down from the mountains,

246
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,548
he would see how it is.

247
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:24,844
The deer and elk stay wide
of the valley, now.

248
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:27,472
To hunt them

249
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,141
we must follow west
where K'uu-ch'ish hunts

250
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:33,603
or east where there are Pima.

251
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,231
And fight our neighbors

252
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:38,066
in places sacred to them.

253
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:42,111
All for fear
of a few tents at the river.

254
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,074
Pionsenay

255
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:49,536
what did you hunt?

256
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:52,497
We can't eat that.

257
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:55,416
I shouldn't see the Mimbreños
of the plains where I go,

258
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,669
but now I have.

259
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,421
I saw one of these men

260
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,341
hunted and killed
for taking a deer,

261
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,718
from where he shouldn't be.

262
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,971
We saw him killed,

263
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,640
beneath us,

264
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,308
over a deer.

265
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:16,062
My family is well provided for
in the high places.

266
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,273
We aren't hungry.

267
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,944
We don't live in fear.

268
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:25,238
Pionsenay grew impatient

269
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:28,032
watching the white-eyes
on the plains.

270
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,952
Now he has brought them
into my home.

271
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,080
Do you see this?

272
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,248
This is what I brought.

273
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:37,917
They are no more danger to you

274
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,003
than the ones

275
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:43,464
who lost them, at the river.

276
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:48,011
The men are gone. I see that.

277
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,387
But where they've been

278
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,888
their sons will follow.

279
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,726
And when they are able

280
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,478
the sons will hunt after you.

281
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:01,065
And they will hunt
after all the People,

282
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:05,403
not knowing
which of us you are.

283
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:10,116
It will be the same for them,
as well as their sons.

284
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,702
But they will not
find me asleep

285
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:15,496
in the mountains
like my father,

286
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,832
who was once
a great war-chief,

287
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,168
but who has grown old.

288
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:23,379
Then you will leave here.

289
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:27,258
Yes. I leave this place

290
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,843
where the People

291
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,929
are too frightened
to sing for me.

292
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:36,392
This, too, was in my dream.

293
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:40,063
You will go and wait for
the white-eyes on the plain

294
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,981
and you will not sleep.

295
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:46,110
you who've made these people
your enemy.

296
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,489
You will fight them
for as long as you are able,

297
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:51,616
and still they will come.

298
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,118
And when you wish to hide

299
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,246
the high places
will no longer hide you.

300
00:40:57,246 --> 00:41:00,958
Then you'll see
the white-eyes I see.

301
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:05,463
And you will know

302
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:10,843
why I don't sing
for your victory today.

303
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:16,974
Now they can choose,

304
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,769
who are free to go
as they will.

305
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:26,818
I have no more to tell them.

306
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,864
I take this,

307
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,702
so it won't disturb the sleep

308
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:37,620
of an old man.

309
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,249
Mr. Ganz?

310
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,044
Son?

311
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:29,714
It appears your ma and father

312
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,632
went up to their reward
this morning...

313
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:36,262
leaving us down here
with the work.

314
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,976
You take a moment now,
if you need it,

315
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,020
and when you're ready,
you let me know.

316
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:50,067
It's gonna be all right.

317
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,294
Follow it out some.

318
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:10,838
See if they stay grouped,

319
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,173
or if any cut back.

320
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:39,367
How you like this, vato?

321
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,580
Some of your lady friends
in there.

322
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,127
You know this one here?

323
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,544
You all bought title to this land

324
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:16,047
from Mr. Pickering, I realize.

325
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:19,467
And I'm sorry because now
you know what you bought.

326
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,762
The men who hunt this land,

327
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:23,971
they're not gonna share it
with you.

328
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:31,354
What you build,
they will burn down.

329
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:33,648
The site you chose
is not one we can defend,

330
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:36,067
as the Indigenous
are well aware.

331
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:40,196
Twenty-six miles north of here
is the Camp Gallant settlement.

332
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:43,074
You will have the protection
of the United States Army.

333
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,746
Get an escort to it right now,
if you're ready to go.

334
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:53,501
But that's it.

335
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,296
That's your offer.

336
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,006
Lieutenant?

337
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:04,971
You got one hour.

338
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,393
That house up there, sir.

339
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:12,019
We found something.

340
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,317
Hurry up. Come on! Hurry up!

341
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,089
No!

342
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,591
No!

343
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,680
Leave her alone.
Leave her, leave her!

344
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,476
No!

345
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,228
Let her do it on her own.
Oh, God.

346
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,234
Hey. Hey.

347
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,071
Momma?

348
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,865
Just take her. Okay?

349
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:06,907
Momma?

350
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:08,868
Ma'am?

351
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:12,538
Ma'am?

352
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:14,790
Ma'am?

353
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:19,962
Is there anyone else in there?

354
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:24,592
Senora, anyone else?

355
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:27,136
It was just us.

356
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:31,849
It was just us, sir.

357
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:54,830
My sister is not the same person.

358
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,083
She doesn't have the man for her home,

359
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,753
whom she loved before she was born.

360
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,673
There's no more father
for her daughters.

361
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,384
They'll have a father.

362
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:10,971
They'll come with us.

363
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,182
Why would anyone
want to go with you?

364
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:22,441
Will the white-eyes
from the river

365
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,985
come to us, now?

366
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,737
No

367
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:30,074
The people are safe here.

368
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:34,245
But more white-eyes
will come to the river.

369
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:36,747
That is the old man's dream.

370
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,916
What is your dream, Taklishim?

371
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,505
I don't dream about this.

372
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:48,092
They have come and put
their sticks in our way,

373
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:49,844
and it's our bad luck

374
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:51,137
they've done this.

375
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,515
That's all I know.

376
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,559
It's bad luck.

377
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,829
Good girl.

378
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:44,875
You go stay with your ma now.
We'll take good care of this.

379
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:20,244
You'll be gone, dear.

380
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:23,831
You'll be all right.

381
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,708
It's just for a short while.

382
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:33,257
You'll be gone
the moment I let you go...

383
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:37,052
and soon I'll be along...

384
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:42,808
and I'll hold you again
just like this, my sweet boy.

385
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:49,523
Soon, I will.

386
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:54,236
I promise you.

387
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:20,804
If he goes,

388
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,639
I go with him.

389
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:28,687
Come here.

390
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:36,111
You listened to what was said.

391
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:39,656
Did you understand?

392
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,456
Good.

393
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:51,835
I'm glad my son

394
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:57,257
knows who he is.

395
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,310
It has told me

396
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,187
where ponies of mine were

397
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,314
that were stolen.

398
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,649
You can speak to it

399
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:19,321
when there's trouble.

400
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:27,871
I think...
I will see you again.

401
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:59,445
And what is there for you?

402
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:09,163
What I give you?

403
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:15,627
I don't need the gift my brother has.

404
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:18,839
You give me enough.

405
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:27,014
You talk to me like my first fathers.

406
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:31,643
You're not angry when I do it.

407
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:47,534
I'm glad my sons know
who they are.

408
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,066
They ain't coming.

409
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:21,318
Yeah? Well, till they enlist,

410
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,362
I guess they can do
what they want.

411
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:24,821
Who are those four?

412
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,907
They just showed up
from over to Union.

413
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:28,575
See if they can't help.

414
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:29,451
Yeah?

415
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,870
Help how?

416
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,872
Just thought someone here
might be of a mind

417
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,249
to hunt Apaches,

418
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:38,043
which, of course,
they're right.

419
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:40,712
Talk now is how they might
make commerce out of it.

420
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,590
And you'd go along, I guess.

421
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,842
And some others.

422
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,553
Scouts said they'd go, too.

423
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:52,224
Rather chase Apaches
than dig your ditches, I guess.

424
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:02,192
You'd be a better man than us,
Lieutenant,

425
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:05,237
if you can look on all this
and turn around.

426
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:06,572
You know, it'd be unusual

427
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:08,156
if you were paid
just to track anyone.

428
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,658
Though I heard of towns
taking up collections

429
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:10,909
to pay for dead Indians.

430
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:15,455
You think that's what
they meant by "commerce"?

431
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,749
Yeah? They said
what you'll get?

432
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,167
About a hundred each?

433
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:21,670
About that.

434
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:23,630
But that'd be
just for the men though.

435
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,340
Because if you bring in
a woman's scalp

436
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,259
or a child, then it'd be, what?

437
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:28,760
Somewhat less, I bet.

438
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,722
Somewhat less than that.
That's right.

439
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:35,225
Yeah. 'Course a Pima's got
the long hair like an Apache.

440
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:36,893
They do.

441
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,937
So has the Hopi and the Yuma.

442
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:41,398
Heck, even the Mexicans
got dark enough hair,
come to that.

443
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:46,278
You know, I don't know
if I was buying scalps,

444
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:48,405
if I could tell one
from the other.

445
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,907
Well, good you ain't
in the market, then.

446
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,868
All right, go on.
No point in that.

447
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:57,706
Look, Lieutenant,

448
00:56:57,706 --> 00:57:01,209
they all know what you make
of trading in dead Injuns.

449
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:03,670
But you said you ain't
the law up here, either.

450
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,088
You have to expect

451
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,757
they're gonna look out
for themselves.

452
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:08,383
There's about 20-25 Apaches
attacked these people,

453
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,427
and a few thousand more
that didn't.

454
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,013
And most tolerate us,
if they don't like us.

455
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:15,932
But if we're not careful,
and you give them reason,

456
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,393
they'll rid this country of us
in about a day's work.

457
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,561
You come along, then.

458
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,396
Keep an eye on us.

459
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,731
And we'll just get
the bad ones.

460
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:25,776
And if you can't,

461
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:27,778
it isn't my fault.

462
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:29,529
I can detail you more men.
I can gather volunteers.

463
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:31,531
Yeah, you'll be about
a day behind,

464
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:34,368
if they let you come back
at all, which I doubt.

465
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,581
I do appreciate the spot
you're in, Lieutenant.

466
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,668
But you understand
why I can't wait on you.

467
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:44,836
Just have to trust we know
our business, I guess.

468
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,985
I don't follow Pionsenay.

469
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:13,782
I'll follow you.

470
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:23,542
All right, I got you.

471
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:25,627
- You all right?
- Yes, thank you.

472
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:47,315
For senora. From Lieutenant.

473
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,145
Let's go do the chickens.

474
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:57,237
Two o'clock.

475
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:58,697
Uh-huh.

476
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:00,365
When?

477
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:02,784
What was it? Two? Maybe you'd
better say it again.

478
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:05,495
Yeah, that's right,
but you ain't funny.

479
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,997
Don't bring anyone home.

480
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,498
I won't.

481
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:11,167
Walter says you're fixed
for money now, anyway.

482
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,753
Yeah, that's what he thinks.

483
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,839
If you can't make it home
alone, honey, and on time,

484
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,382
you can just keep going.

485
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,410
Sally?

486
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,787
Go make up six, seven,
and eight.

487
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,498
- Yes, ma'am.
- Now. Get a move on.

488
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,150
Yeah, that was me.

489
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,569
Marigold, you talk
to any of these men

490
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,987
before I sign them in,

491
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,614
and I'll hold your head
under that water.

492
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:26,826
And if you try and take
any of my business

493
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,578
up to Ellen's tonight,

494
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,038
we'll come visit you.

495
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:31,539
Just see if I'm kidding.

496
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:35,835
Let's clear out these chairs.
Bill?

497
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,754
Get up!

498
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:42,467
I'm trying to see
if we can't get Mr. Coughlin

499
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:43,969
out of the stairwell.

500
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,569
I've got a favor to ask you.

501
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:15,542
You'll get this back
before we pay anyone out,

502
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:16,835
I promise you.

503
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:20,005
Yeah. Good luck in there.

504
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:21,339
I'm not far behind you.

505
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:52,829
I stay...

506
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:55,290
I stay on by...

507
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:02,589
...by contract
to Fort Bridger...

508
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:06,342
and I thought
to go north and...

509
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:10,930
Jesus.

510
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,433
North and west from there.

511
01:04:16,478 --> 01:04:20,815
Though if I am needed,
or if...

512
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:25,904
or if your condition...
condition holds the same, I...

513
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:34,621
Why don't you help her?

514
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,415
She ain't buying anything.

515
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:40,376
Mary, do you want
to excuse us?

516
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,339
He's writing you
a letter, sir?

517
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:48,051
Yeah. It's private.
He asked if I could.

518
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:50,178
Oh. Can you, Ned?

519
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,348
I do all right.

520
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:55,558
He's not the clerk here,
so you know.

521
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,102
He's just standing in.

522
01:04:57,102 --> 01:05:00,146
Though I'm sure
he'll take your money.

523
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,857
Yes, get your spectacles on,
Ned. That'll help.

524
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,442
And how'd Miss Harvey like to know

525
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:06,528
you're lagging down here,
you think?

526
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:07,779
That's all right.

527
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:10,865
I only came in
to get the time.

528
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:12,158
I beg you pardon, mister.

529
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:14,410
Go on, Mary.

530
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,995
That's short for Marigold.

531
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:18,164
And I'd have him read back

532
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,165
what he wrote
when you're done.

533
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,474
- You know how to write?
- Yes, sir.

534
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:38,643
She was just funning me.

535
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:40,979
Go ahead.

536
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:54,242
Whoever reads that letter
is gonna think

537
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:55,618
you're shy of brains.

538
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:04,085
Yeah, well,
between him and me, we...

539
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:08,298
we got a good part of it.

540
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:11,593
You know, I think it's fine,
you know, you still write home

541
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:13,136
and send money.

542
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:16,472
I think it shows...
think it shows character.

543
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:18,933
Yeah?

544
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:21,394
I saw Mrs. Daly take
your friends up in there.

545
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:23,730
That where you'll stay?

546
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,859
Well, her husband waters down
his spirits, you know.

547
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:29,861
Mm-hm.
He calls it "Indies rum."

548
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:31,988
He just collects out
the used glasses

549
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,907
and he browns them
with tobacco.

550
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:36,117
Yeah?

551
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,076
Yeah.

552
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:42,540
And if you meet a girl
called Celine,

553
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,459
just know she's married...

554
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:47,337
and her husband's
probably in there watching.

555
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:50,757
And there's another that says

556
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:52,508
she was born
in Paris, France,

557
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:55,011
but that's a trick
that only works once.

558
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,930
She drinks that accent off
in about a minute.

559
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,099
And the other,
if she's being friendly,

560
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:02,769
she's gonna ask you
for "consideration."

561
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:03,937
That means...

562
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:04,979
I know.

563
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:09,359
I know what it means.

564
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,236
Well, it means you'll wait
in line upstairs.

565
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:15,782
Yeah, well, you know,
I was just gonna

566
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:18,618
find my room and sleep.

567
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:20,870
Good luck then.

568
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,914
With that barrel-organ
under you.

569
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:24,791
Jesus Christ.

570
01:07:29,504 --> 01:07:33,174
But, hey,
if you like something quiet...

571
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:36,094
you know, there's a nice cabin
just up there.

572
01:07:36,094 --> 01:07:37,845
- Top of that trail.
- Yeah?

573
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:38,888
That one's mine.

574
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,265
It ain't hers.

575
01:07:40,265 --> 01:07:42,141
Well, I didn't say
I owned it, did I?

576
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:46,896
But you come up
and I'll make you

577
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:49,774
a better dinner
than Mrs. Daly.

578
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,818
I mean, you can't even see
all this, looking down,

579
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:53,236
just the trees.

580
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:57,657
No. Nah.

581
01:07:57,657 --> 01:07:59,200
Oh, what,
you think I'll have you

582
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,494
propose marriage to me
in the morning?

583
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,664
What?

584
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:08,584
Or I'd ask you to take me away
from here? To where?

585
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:10,962
I mean, you're just going on
to some other mining camp.

586
01:08:10,962 --> 01:08:12,839
It's probably worse than this.

587
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:15,425
Yeah and I guess you don't ask
for a "consideration," do you?

588
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,846
Oh, you wouldn't have to.

589
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:22,432
You might be moved to,
but I wouldn't ask.

590
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:34,527
Well, I'd just like
to have a drink tonight

591
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:36,779
with someone
that knows how to act.

592
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:40,575
And maybe has something
to say I don't already know.

593
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:42,910
And I'd rather he's tall.
That's what I want.

594
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:47,874
Well, we got one taller.

595
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:49,208
Oh, you mean
the one with the laugh?

596
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:52,211
Mm-mm. I'm particular.

597
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:53,421
If it's not you tonight,

598
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:54,881
I'll just stay in
with the baby.

599
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:58,259
With the...?

600
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:02,513
The baby. Yeah.

601
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:04,682
I mean, it's just me with him
tonight, but he won't mind.

602
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,643
Yeah, yeah.
Well, what about his father?

603
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:08,853
How...

604
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:10,938
How would he like this?

605
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:13,066
Well, you don't think
it's my child.

606
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:15,985
Oh, God, no.
He's got a mother.

607
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,236
She's just out today.

608
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:19,030
She's got me
looking after him.

609
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:21,532
Yeah? Well,
why aren't you then?

610
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:24,535
I am.

611
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:26,329
- Yeah.
- I'm going.

612
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:29,457
Anyway, nothing's
gonna eat the kid

613
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:30,625
if he's alone a minute.

614
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,463
And he sleeps through
to anything.

615
01:09:35,463 --> 01:09:36,714
I promise you that.

616
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:48,476
So you think
you'll come say hello?

617
01:09:54,065 --> 01:09:56,484
And I won't have any trouble
finding this place?

618
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:00,655
Uh-uh.

619
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:03,908
Well, it's just straight up
that draw.

620
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:06,202
Once you can't get
any further, that's it.

621
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:07,745
That's me.

622
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:10,832
Don't make me wait.

623
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,099
Lizzie?

624
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:13,436
Lizzie?

625
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:14,479
Momma?

626
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:18,357
Momma?

627
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:20,902
Lizzie.

628
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:25,823
Honey, what are you doing?

629
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:26,949
What are you doing?

630
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:35,416
Okay.

631
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:36,542
Okay, you're gonna
put these on.

632
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:37,877
No, Mom.
No, that's where it was.

633
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:38,878
- Put them on.
- It was in my shoe.

634
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:39,921
I shook it out.

635
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:11,661
About done?

636
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:13,913
No! I don't have
a single goddamn pot

637
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:15,957
to match with a single one
of my goddamn lids.

638
01:12:15,957 --> 01:12:19,794
All right. Well, it's ten past.
Said we'd be gone by three.

639
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,964
You talk to Mary?

640
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:25,341
No, we're leaving.
You talk to her after.

641
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,134
Little skank looked me
right in the eye

642
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:29,011
and promised me.
I told her two o'clock.

643
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,596
All right, well,
it's not my fault.

644
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:31,973
Here, honey, you play with this.

645
01:12:31,973 --> 01:12:33,975
Ell? Ellen?

646
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:35,977
I can't miss this over some

647
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:37,645
idiot girl wanting
to make us wait.

648
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:40,022
She brings more money in
than you, Walter.

649
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:41,857
Well... Yeah, well...

650
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:44,569
That...

651
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:46,821
Go then if you can't wait.
You go.

652
01:12:46,821 --> 01:12:50,408
No. No. No. Ellen, I said
that we would. Both of us.

653
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:54,203
And I said that I wouldn't
leave Sam alone.

654
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:56,706
You promised me that.
When have I ever done that?

655
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:58,040
Have I ever done that?

656
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,250
Have you ever seen me
leave him alone?

657
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:01,043
Never!

658
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:03,004
Ellen.

659
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:04,672
Honey, don't put that
in your mouth.

660
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:07,675
This is business now,
and you can't say one thing

661
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:09,552
and turn around
and do something else.

662
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:13,139
Walter...

663
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:17,727
if these men want
to buy something from you,

664
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:18,769
they're gonna buy it.

665
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:20,271
They ain't gonna look at me

666
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:23,149
or whatever the hell it is
you're wearing.

667
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,489
All I know is we had
three chickens this morning...

668
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:33,117
and now I got one.

669
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:34,702
And whoever
the hell these men are,

670
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:36,621
they're fixing to eat better
than our family.

671
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:38,497
Ellen.

672
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,502
There she is!

673
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:45,713
When'd I tell you
to get up here? Huh?

674
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:48,716
I said we needed you
an hour ago!

675
01:13:50,885 --> 01:13:52,178
What do you expect?

676
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:54,180
You're gonna leave him
alone up here?

677
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:56,641
Mary, goddamn it.
He's two years old.

678
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:00,978
Jesus.

679
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:05,066
What, are you worried
that you're gonna

680
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:07,234
get a clean spot
on your reputation,

681
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:08,944
if you let up for one minute?

682
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:10,321
Shame on you.

683
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:11,656
Nothing I do down there
is any worse

684
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:13,240
than you had to do before him.

685
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,617
What'd you say to me?

686
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:16,577
I'm just saying
there's some ladies

687
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:17,787
that can take that high tone
with me.

688
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:18,954
I don't know you can.

689
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:20,665
I'll take
any goddamn tone I want.

690
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:21,999
I'm talking about my boy!

691
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:25,294
You get up there!
You get to him.

692
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:26,921
You try saying
that line to me again

693
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:28,756
and you'll see how fast
you are down there,

694
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:30,925
living in a goddamned barrel.

695
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:32,635
All right.
It's done. It's done.

696
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:34,929
Elly, come on. Come on now.

697
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:36,806
We're gonna talk later!
That's what we're doing!

698
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:38,432
All right.
You're gonna talk later.

699
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:40,309
- Let's go. I'm ready.
- All right.

700
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:43,896
See how fast you go down
there in our good graces.

701
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:45,523
All right.
Please, let's go.

702
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:46,774
We're late, honey.

703
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:48,234
We are.

704
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:50,986
I know. I don't like
that yelling either.

705
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:52,613
Come on in the house, mister.

706
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,257
Let me just say...

707
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:14,885
if they found even just
a little placer downstream...

708
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:16,178
they might judge from that

709
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,513
that there's
a deposit higher up.

710
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,224
Maybe around my plot.

711
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:22,435
Did they?

712
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:24,103
Did they find
something like that?

713
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,357
Did you leave something
for them to find, Walter?

714
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,361
All I know...

715
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:33,904
- Jesus.
- All I...

716
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:38,993
Shit.

717
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:32,004
Sir.

718
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:37,051
Ma'am.

719
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:41,347
You get your first look
at camp in daylight?

720
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:43,808
Yes.

721
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,227
Yes, it's very nice.

722
01:16:49,063 --> 01:16:50,231
Lieutenant, I haven't

723
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:53,150
thanked you yet
for taking us in.

724
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:55,361
And really,
for all that you've done.

725
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:01,367
Elizabeth wanted to thank you
herself, but I don't...

726
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:06,997
We brushed it for you, sir.

727
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:15,881
Well, look at that.
Yeah? Thank you.

728
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:17,424
Has the doctor seen you two?

729
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,260
No, sir.

730
01:17:21,512 --> 01:17:22,930
He'd been drinking.

731
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,056
Lizzie!

732
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:52,751
Sir,

733
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:54,003
we were gonna escort them over
to mess. Give Mr. Vreeland

734
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:55,588
- a chance to...
- No, no.

735
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:56,881
He'll clear them before
they wander through camp.

736
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:57,798
We were only going
to the kitchen

737
01:17:57,798 --> 01:17:59,258
to volunteer, Lieutenant.

738
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:01,385
We weren't expecting any...

739
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:16,901
Ma'am.

740
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:17,985
Miss.

741
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:20,821
Apologies for the delay.

742
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:25,910
Let's get you inside.

743
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:28,287
Not at all.

744
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:39,131
Sit you down, Mr. Gephart.

745
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:44,136
Hear you were up there
making speeches.

746
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:46,263
Thirty mad Apaches couldn't
scare these people off.

747
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:47,681
Thought maybe you could?

748
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:50,184
I owed it to them to try,
I thought.

749
01:18:50,184 --> 01:18:52,895
The ones I saw weren't fit
to live out there, sir.

750
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:54,647
Did make it through
what sounds like a long night.

751
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:57,399
Yeah.

752
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,610
And this here, where you want
to detail ten more,

753
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:01,070
ride up into the mountains?

754
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,821
- I'm gonna deny that one.
- Sir...

755
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:05,950
I expect your protest. Here.

756
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:07,618
Let's put it down in writing.

757
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:11,830
We'll look into it,
soon as I can spare the men.

758
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:14,166
Which, as you know,
right now I can't.

759
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:17,336
Have you seen this?

760
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:18,963
Yeah. I brought it to you.

761
01:19:18,963 --> 01:19:20,506
No, when you were up there.
Have you seen this town?

762
01:19:21,799 --> 01:19:24,009
No? You should have asked.

763
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:25,761
They would have pointed it
out to you.

764
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:28,555
He doesn't believe me.

765
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:31,141
He thinks this comes of your
drinking before noon, sir.

766
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:32,184
Hm.

767
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:34,937
I realize
whatever was there,

768
01:19:34,937 --> 01:19:36,230
and I gather it wasn't much,

769
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:38,148
it's all gone down
in ash again.

770
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:41,026
But the Apache haven't put
a scratch on this, have they?

771
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:45,239
You just have
to stand at the river

772
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:46,532
and you can see
what the men

773
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:47,992
and the women up there see.

774
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:53,163
You have to bear in mind,

775
01:19:53,163 --> 01:19:55,332
they don't come out here
the way we do.

776
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:56,625
These people have been pushing

777
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,210
the same wheel
back home around

778
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:01,630
and around till they can't
bear another turn on it.

779
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:04,133
That's the path
they inherit...

780
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:06,260
and if they try
to change it at all,

781
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:09,179
they have to do it by inches.

782
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:11,598
You may recall that's what
drove us across the ocean

783
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:13,308
to this country,
in the first place.

784
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:18,731
You and I are standing guard

785
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:21,567
on one of the last
great open spaces, Trent.

786
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:24,153
There's no army of this earth

787
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:26,071
that's gonna stop
those wagons coming...

788
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:28,323
little as they're wanted.

789
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:31,326
So I guess you'd like
to explain that

790
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:32,369
to the Indigenous.

791
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:35,205
I know.

792
01:20:35,205 --> 01:20:37,583
That may be a thing that never
does get explained to them.

793
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:41,420
Now, your Apache,
he thinks that if he can

794
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,047
salt the earth
with enough of our dead,

795
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:45,716
that he'll stop
those wagons coming.

796
01:20:45,716 --> 01:20:47,468
Spoil the place for us.

797
01:20:47,468 --> 01:20:49,595
But you study the newcomers.

798
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:51,388
They'll look out
at ever so many graves

799
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:53,098
and it won't make
the least difference...

800
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:57,811
because all they see is this.

801
01:20:57,811 --> 01:20:59,313
The place isn't unlucky,

802
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:02,066
it's just the poor bastard
under it.

803
01:21:02,066 --> 01:21:03,942
And that's what a man will
tell himself, tell his wife,

804
01:21:03,942 --> 01:21:05,694
and they'll tell
their children

805
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:07,279
that if they're
tough enough,

806
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:09,031
smart enough,
and mean enough,

807
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:12,451
all this
will be theirs someday.

808
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:16,371
That's all they'll reason
in the face of fear.

809
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:20,000
They're the ones
that are gonna hold out.

810
01:21:20,834 --> 01:21:22,002
And guess what?

811
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:24,171
Some of them will.

812
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:28,092
Anyhow...

813
01:21:30,636 --> 01:21:32,846
for the time being,
I won't commit

814
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:34,598
a body to the field
when I don't have to.

815
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:39,561
You'll just have to count
the Indians and count us,

816
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:41,480
and you won't have
to wonder at that logic.

817
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:46,652
Now you and I have to look out
for our own survival, Trent...

818
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:51,115
and let this place
do what it's done

819
01:21:51,115 --> 01:21:52,783
since time immemorial.

820
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:02,626
And maybe
this Mr. Pickering...

821
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:05,003
will find
a likelier spot to settle

822
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:06,880
than an Apache river-crossing.

823
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:13,971
Did I give that young man

824
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:16,348
something to think about,
Sergeant?

825
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:18,016
Or did I just make him angry?

826
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:20,811
Some of both, sir, I expect.

827
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:22,855
How's that?

828
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:29,820
Well, these great movements
that you describe, sir...

829
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:34,158
he'd like to feel
he's got a hand in 'em.

830
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:39,371
But that's a young man's
vanity, is it not?

831
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:42,082
What'll happen here is only
what's bound to happen.

832
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:46,295
As he'll live to observe.

833
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:48,338
You see, we don't make
our history any more

834
01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:50,465
than the Apache
makes his weather.

835
01:22:52,009 --> 01:22:55,012
And what is bound to happen?
In your view?

836
01:22:57,848 --> 01:22:59,558
It's as much as you say, sir.

837
01:23:00,893 --> 01:23:02,060
We'll muddle through,

838
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:04,563
while they decide things
back home.

839
01:23:04,563 --> 01:23:05,981
And when they do...

840
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:08,775
when that war ends...

841
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:09,985
and it will end,

842
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,029
whether we're one nation
or two.

843
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:17,492
They'll all start
looking west again, sir.

844
01:23:19,578 --> 01:23:22,206
And then these
open spaces you mention...

845
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:26,418
that the Aboriginal
love so well...

846
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:30,631
that they say
they can't live without.

847
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:34,384
Well, sir...

848
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:39,097
they'll all close up
in a blink of an eye, sir.

849
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:43,852
That's how it ends here.

850
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,772
I believe that's how
all the frontier ends.

851
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:49,524
And both of us dead and damned
before that with any luck.

852
01:23:51,401 --> 01:23:53,362
Aye, sir.

853
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:55,197
There is that consolation.

854
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:09,628
Oh, God.

855
01:24:11,004 --> 01:24:12,798
Now I'm nervous.

856
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:16,093
Oh, no, honey.
This is our day.

857
01:24:17,636 --> 01:24:18,887
Huh.

858
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:19,805
Come on.

859
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:25,143
And don't you feel bad for
these men with money, Ell...

860
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:29,648
'cause they don't waste
a thought on us.

861
01:24:34,278 --> 01:24:39,074
You know what Mary said about
how I was, before we met.

862
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:40,993
- Oh, that's all right.
- No.

863
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:43,036
She shouldn't have said that.

864
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:45,414
I'm sorry she said that
in front of you.

865
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,752
You're a good man.

866
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:54,673
I see how you try and be
a good man to me. I...

867
01:24:57,676 --> 01:24:59,219
I haven't known many good men.

868
01:25:05,809 --> 01:25:06,685
All right.

869
01:25:07,686 --> 01:25:08,603
It's our day.

870
01:25:09,271 --> 01:25:10,147
Hmm?

871
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:13,608
It's our day.

872
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:20,782
Hi, Mike.

873
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:24,411
I'd like you to meet
Miss Harvey.

874
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:27,039
How do you do, Mike?

875
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:29,374
Pleasure. You need help?

876
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:32,753
Oh, no. We're...
we're all right.

877
01:25:32,753 --> 01:25:33,920
I got this here.

878
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:36,423
You hold on to that.

879
01:25:36,423 --> 01:25:37,924
We'll let you
show them yourself.

880
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:42,888
They here?

881
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:44,765
Yeah. Just taking another turn
around the property.

882
01:25:44,765 --> 01:25:46,016
All right.

883
01:25:46,016 --> 01:25:47,392
We'll get you ready inside.

884
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:03,283
You don't know, Mike,
if, uh, your friends

885
01:26:03,283 --> 01:26:06,244
happen to find something
out there, huh?

886
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:08,038
Maybe something I don't know?

887
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:10,707
They say anything like that?

888
01:26:12,459 --> 01:26:13,502
Ask them.

889
01:26:15,629 --> 01:26:16,922
You know, I said I'd talk
to these men,

890
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:18,465
and for you I'd do that.

891
01:26:18,465 --> 01:26:22,302
But, God,

892
01:26:22,302 --> 01:26:23,970
I get up here
and I get the sense

893
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:26,431
that someone's making
a strike here,

894
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:30,769
and I'm as sure of that now
as ever, and it just...

895
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:32,229
well, it does give me
second thoughts

896
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:33,980
about letting it all go.

897
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:35,107
Where are you from?

898
01:26:36,733 --> 01:26:38,151
I know you, don't I?

899
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:39,486
You want to tell me
where I know you from?

900
01:26:39,486 --> 01:26:40,695
Honey, what are you doing?

901
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:41,655
Where is it?

902
01:26:41,655 --> 01:26:44,241
Hey. Ell, just stop it.

903
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:47,035
Let him alone. Christ.

904
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:52,833
I'm sorry, Mike. I don't know
what's gotten into her here.

905
01:26:58,088 --> 01:26:59,381
Oh my...

906
01:27:00,841 --> 01:27:01,925
My God.

907
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:04,511
Well...

908
01:27:05,554 --> 01:27:08,265
as I live and breathe.

909
01:27:09,683 --> 01:27:11,017
You see this, brother?

910
01:27:12,269 --> 01:27:14,813
Hey, could you not do that?

911
01:27:21,153 --> 01:27:23,113
Sorry. You must be, uh...

912
01:27:24,531 --> 01:27:25,866
I'm Walter Childs.

913
01:27:31,288 --> 01:27:32,164
Uh...

914
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:36,460
You know, just don't mind her.
Uh, she actually made us

915
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:38,920
- some pretty good...
- Be quiet.

916
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,465
- Walt? Come here.
- Oh, Mike, it's okay.

917
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:42,799
He said be quiet.

918
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:45,719
Yeah. Sit tight.

919
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:51,600
We nearly met in Bannack.

920
01:27:55,604 --> 01:27:56,855
I believe we did.

921
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,442
And you had
any number of brushes

922
01:28:00,442 --> 01:28:01,776
since then though, I hear.

923
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:07,699
Seemed to find an instinct
for staying ahead of us.

924
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:11,953
Or you got
some angel over you.

925
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:18,585
All right, well,
we'll let Ellen set the table.

926
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:21,296
And, here,
you and I will have this.

927
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:22,631
I got us a very good...

928
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:24,132
Walter, you interrupt
my brother again

929
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:25,634
and I will beat you
right in front of her.

930
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:27,344
I swear to God. I really will.

931
01:28:30,764 --> 01:28:32,057
And her name's Lucy, you fool.

932
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:33,350
Caleb.

933
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:34,518
Let them talk.

934
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:42,400
I guess you know
he's not dead, our father.

935
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:45,111
You don't know how it was.

936
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:46,863
You never had to take a turn
with that man.

937
01:28:46,863 --> 01:28:49,074
Crawled some good way
after you.

938
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:52,536
Face half-carved away
and chest full of shot.

939
01:28:52,536 --> 01:28:55,205
Like they threw blood on him
out a barrel.

940
01:28:55,205 --> 01:28:57,123
I never did tell your mother.

941
01:28:57,123 --> 01:28:58,333
Or anybody else.

942
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,501
That should count
for something.

943
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:02,003
It doesn't.

944
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:06,341
You must know
we'd come for you,

945
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:07,676
whether he lived or not.

946
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:10,762
But...

947
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:14,266
God, I hardly thought
it would take so long.

948
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:16,101
I had days with no point

949
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:17,769
or end to any of this
I could see.

950
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:19,729
I just wanted
to burn this whole territory

951
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:21,773
and hope you were in it.

952
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:24,276
I was that sick to get home.

953
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:26,945
They're just gonna
take her back.

954
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:29,197
They're just gonna
take you back, honey.

955
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:33,535
I'll be honest with you, Mike,
I don't think she makes it.

956
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:34,786
As much as our father
would give to see her.

957
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:36,037
They can't have her home.

958
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:37,872
- Sit down and eat.
- She knows that.

959
01:29:37,872 --> 01:29:38,999
I ate.

960
01:29:41,334 --> 01:29:45,922
See, he knows we're only
after your boy, ma'am.

961
01:29:45,922 --> 01:29:47,841
I'm sorry,
but this ain't hardly to do

962
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:49,301
with you at all
and he knows that.

963
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:50,510
Caleb?

964
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:51,928
You don't know
where I left him.

965
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:55,432
Well,

966
01:29:55,432 --> 01:29:57,976
he said you got a girl tending
to him, up to your own house.

967
01:29:57,976 --> 01:29:59,769
Now I'm just thinking
maybe we start there.

968
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:01,438
Okay, well, they're not gonna
let you just take him

969
01:30:01,438 --> 01:30:02,856
out of his goddamn bed.

970
01:30:02,856 --> 01:30:06,568
You think anyone out here
stops him, huh?

971
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:10,488
Stand over there and shut up
until I'm done talking.

972
01:30:10,488 --> 01:30:11,615
Do it right now.

973
01:30:13,325 --> 01:30:14,701
- Excuse me...
- Honey.

974
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:16,244
I got to remind you all
why you're here?

975
01:30:17,537 --> 01:30:18,413
Huh?

976
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:22,626
This, right here.

977
01:30:22,626 --> 01:30:24,044
That's your title
to this property.

978
01:30:24,044 --> 01:30:25,128
Now, if you just...

979
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:26,630
If you want to sit,

980
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:28,423
we can start
to properly discuss...

981
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:30,800
You still think we're talking
about your damn mine?

982
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:31,676
Come here!

983
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:37,390
It's like an illness with you.
Isn't it?

984
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:38,558
Your talking?

985
01:30:42,187 --> 01:30:45,732
Look, look, y'all...
y'all settle this,
whatever it is.

986
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:49,694
You settle it when we're done,
but she has no part in this.

987
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:51,863
All right? You even said.

988
01:30:51,863 --> 01:30:53,073
All right. All right. I'm just

989
01:30:53,073 --> 01:30:54,240
gonna let her out
while we talk.

990
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,200
Come here.

991
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,868
You just stay there.

992
01:30:57,786 --> 01:31:00,705
Stop it! Jesus!

993
01:31:03,917 --> 01:31:04,876
Hey!

994
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:08,380
What did I tell you?

995
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:09,923
Hmm?

996
01:31:19,599 --> 01:31:20,433
What?

997
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:24,562
Oh.

998
01:31:24,562 --> 01:31:27,941
Oh, I think I got him
with that first knock. Huh?

999
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:39,494
- Goddamn it.
- Jesus Christ.

1000
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:42,831
Why, you little...

1001
01:31:42,831 --> 01:31:45,125
- She'll answer...
- Not to you.

1002
01:31:45,125 --> 01:31:46,292
You're done in here.

1003
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:48,962
Hell, I am.

1004
01:31:54,467 --> 01:31:55,885
Drag his ass out of here.

1005
01:32:00,473 --> 01:32:02,851
Get your...
get your hands off.

1006
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:04,561
Hands off.

1007
01:32:04,561 --> 01:32:06,855
Come here, boy.
Come here. Come on.

1008
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:14,070
He's done in there.

1009
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:15,447
Get his hat and his coat.

1010
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:18,199
I'll kill you, Joon.
I swear to God.

1011
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:21,870
Yeah? Well,
first you're gonna bury him.

1012
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:23,913
And then you're gonna ride
up there and get that boy.

1013
01:32:23,913 --> 01:32:25,248
Let me see you do all that

1014
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:26,708
before you come back here
and try me.

1015
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:28,293
I ain't goin'.

1016
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:29,377
Yeah, but you are though.

1017
01:32:39,053 --> 01:32:40,930
I want you gone from my sight.

1018
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:47,103
He does the digging.

1019
01:32:57,155 --> 01:33:01,034
Yeah, there's always
the chance of that with Caleb.

1020
01:33:01,034 --> 01:33:02,660
Give me that gun.

1021
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,370
You gonna send him out
like that, after that boy?

1022
01:33:06,498 --> 01:33:07,540
Like what?

1023
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:10,293
Just...

1024
01:33:12,879 --> 01:33:14,297
Nothing.

1025
01:33:14,297 --> 01:33:18,009
All right.
You can wait outside.

1026
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:33,608
Oh dear God.

1027
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:52,877
That one.

1028
01:34:15,942 --> 01:34:17,360
You live in this whore?

1029
01:34:21,823 --> 01:34:23,283
I don't.

1030
01:34:23,283 --> 01:34:27,662
Yeah, you know I don't,
if I had to ask you.

1031
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:30,999
How do you like their idea
of porches, huh?

1032
01:34:30,999 --> 01:34:32,834
Surrounded by trees
and they can't find

1033
01:34:32,834 --> 01:34:34,127
Ten foot of more planks.

1034
01:34:34,127 --> 01:34:35,753
They'd rather live
in this filth.

1035
01:34:35,753 --> 01:34:36,796
Well...

1036
01:34:38,172 --> 01:34:40,049
You came through working,
I guess.

1037
01:34:40,049 --> 01:34:41,593
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1038
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,720
What at?

1039
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:45,471
You don't mind
I'm talking to you?

1040
01:34:46,764 --> 01:34:48,474
No, man.

1041
01:34:48,474 --> 01:34:51,895
I'm here with some others.
Do a trade in horses, mostly.

1042
01:34:51,895 --> 01:34:54,856
Oh, yeah, we had a bit of work
around here ourselves.

1043
01:34:54,856 --> 01:34:56,316
Bit of our own work.

1044
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:00,320
You said "mostly horses."

1045
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:03,281
What does that mean?

1046
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:05,074
It means you do
something else.

1047
01:35:06,618 --> 01:35:08,036
I have, yeah.

1048
01:35:08,036 --> 01:35:09,662
Yeah?

1049
01:35:09,662 --> 01:35:11,331
You work with us, you'd do
more than just horses.

1050
01:35:11,331 --> 01:35:15,710
You'd have to know the use
of that Colt, for one.

1051
01:35:16,419 --> 01:35:17,378
Do you?

1052
01:35:18,504 --> 01:35:20,590
You use that much? This here?

1053
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:21,799
Not the way you mean it.

1054
01:35:21,799 --> 01:35:23,551
How else do you use it?

1055
01:35:23,551 --> 01:35:25,970
Hell, maybe you drive nails with it.

1056
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:28,681
I just mean it's fairly new.

1057
01:35:28,681 --> 01:35:30,683
Haven't had much
need of it yet.

1058
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:33,227
Not yet?

1059
01:35:35,188 --> 01:35:37,857
It looks like we got ourselves
a bad man, right here.

1060
01:35:39,025 --> 01:35:40,276
You know, I'm just saying

1061
01:35:40,276 --> 01:35:41,819
anywhere north of here,

1062
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:43,863
gentlemen like you,
we're who you work for.

1063
01:35:43,863 --> 01:35:45,406
- I got a job.
- Yeah, I know.

1064
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:47,742
I'm just telling you.

1065
01:35:47,742 --> 01:35:51,037
Maybe you heard about a family
called "Sykes."

1066
01:35:51,037 --> 01:35:52,372
- No, I've...
- Oh. Well,

1067
01:35:52,372 --> 01:35:53,581
why didn't
you say something then?

1068
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:54,832
Hell, even the shit-pokes
out here,

1069
01:35:54,832 --> 01:35:56,334
you mention
that name to them,

1070
01:35:56,334 --> 01:35:58,252
you know who you've had
a walk with today.

1071
01:35:58,252 --> 01:36:00,672
Right now you don't know?

1072
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:02,548
- I just told you that.
- Yeah, you don't know.

1073
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:06,052
Ain't heard of us.

1074
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:08,221
Ain't from here.

1075
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:12,475
Maybe you meant
you're from China.

1076
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:15,353
Here.

1077
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:17,772
Steady that.

1078
01:36:30,368 --> 01:36:32,328
You think that's how
they dug this trench here?

1079
01:36:32,328 --> 01:36:34,580
Hell, you get enough people

1080
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:36,332
to piss down a hill
for long enough,

1081
01:36:36,332 --> 01:36:37,875
you might even
come up with a town

1082
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:39,252
that looks
something like that.

1083
01:36:42,088 --> 01:36:44,257
You see...

1084
01:36:44,257 --> 01:36:46,300
it just so happens
a little rabbit we be hunting

1085
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:47,343
went to ground down here.

1086
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:50,263
Yeah...

1087
01:36:52,181 --> 01:36:54,475
and you're smart not to ask
any more about it.

1088
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:00,106
Something you want to say?

1089
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:02,191
Just a bit late.

1090
01:37:04,402 --> 01:37:06,362
Well, can't you talk? Hmm?

1091
01:37:06,362 --> 01:37:08,573
It's like some trick you're
doing waiting for me to talk

1092
01:37:08,573 --> 01:37:10,366
and say more than I want.

1093
01:37:10,366 --> 01:37:12,035
You said you came
through here working?

1094
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:14,704
Yeah, well, what at?

1095
01:37:14,704 --> 01:37:16,456
You ain't got
no horses to show,

1096
01:37:16,456 --> 01:37:18,958
and anything you would like
to buy is back down there.

1097
01:37:18,958 --> 01:37:20,251
No, I'm visiting someone.

1098
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:21,794
Yeah, that's right.

1099
01:37:21,794 --> 01:37:23,379
I'll tell you what else.

1100
01:37:23,379 --> 01:37:24,756
A man doesn't bustle up here

1101
01:37:24,756 --> 01:37:25,715
unless there's a girl
called him up.

1102
01:37:25,715 --> 01:37:26,883
Is that what you meant?

1103
01:37:29,093 --> 01:37:29,927
Hm.

1104
01:37:29,927 --> 01:37:30,887
Yeah.

1105
01:37:31,637 --> 01:37:33,681
Yeah, I see you.

1106
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:35,349
I do. I see you.

1107
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:38,895
I'm just picturing
what sort of mauled bitch

1108
01:37:38,895 --> 01:37:41,397
they keep around here
for a girl.

1109
01:37:41,397 --> 01:37:44,067
Oh, don't give me that look.

1110
01:37:44,901 --> 01:37:45,985
Don't do that.

1111
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:48,488
I will roll your head

1112
01:37:48,488 --> 01:37:49,989
right back down
to your friends.

1113
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:51,699
You think?

1114
01:37:58,915 --> 01:38:01,000
Look at you!

1115
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,668
You got your blood
all boiled up

1116
01:38:02,668 --> 01:38:04,796
over some girl you just met.

1117
01:38:09,383 --> 01:38:10,468
Mmm.

1118
01:38:13,304 --> 01:38:14,722
I didn't say it was a girl.

1119
01:38:16,182 --> 01:38:18,476
And here I am
just trying to be cordial.

1120
01:38:20,228 --> 01:38:21,771
Go on.

1121
01:38:21,771 --> 01:38:23,356
God love both of you.

1122
01:38:29,529 --> 01:38:31,447
- That's awful.
- Yeah.

1123
01:38:31,447 --> 01:38:33,199
Well, there is
good brandy in there,

1124
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:34,492
just don't know what else.

1125
01:38:34,492 --> 01:38:35,535
Yeah.

1126
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:41,040
Odd thing though,
you're running out of houses.

1127
01:38:44,085 --> 01:38:46,754
I just wonder if your girl
ever seen my rabbit.

1128
01:38:48,506 --> 01:38:50,091
I'd be sorry if she did.

1129
01:38:52,135 --> 01:38:54,512
I'll tell you the story
about it, if you want.

1130
01:38:54,512 --> 01:38:55,972
You're bound
to hear about it anyway.

1131
01:38:57,306 --> 01:38:59,267
Nah, we talked enough.

1132
01:38:59,267 --> 01:39:03,855
Well, I will tell you this.

1133
01:39:03,855 --> 01:39:05,898
There ain't much you do
in these territories,

1134
01:39:05,898 --> 01:39:07,817
but what you do do
you're all watched at it

1135
01:39:07,817 --> 01:39:10,236
and I don't mean by God.

1136
01:39:10,236 --> 01:39:13,364
What order there is comes
from me watching you.

1137
01:39:13,364 --> 01:39:15,366
Man watching his fellow.

1138
01:39:15,366 --> 01:39:18,161
Seeing what he'll stand
and what he won't.

1139
01:39:18,161 --> 01:39:21,706
My father says, if they
see you suffer an insult...

1140
01:39:22,623 --> 01:39:24,167
men'll come try you.

1141
01:39:26,252 --> 01:39:28,546
You better make it known
you let no injury pass,

1142
01:39:28,546 --> 01:39:29,630
however small...

1143
01:39:31,174 --> 01:39:32,925
and your judgement is sure...

1144
01:39:33,843 --> 01:39:35,011
and terrible.

1145
01:39:36,762 --> 01:39:38,764
Falter, he says,
and they will take from you,

1146
01:39:38,764 --> 01:39:40,183
and they will keep on taking

1147
01:39:40,183 --> 01:39:42,351
until you are wiped clean
from this land,

1148
01:39:42,351 --> 01:39:43,644
and your name with it.

1149
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:51,110
I'm just saying
that's something

1150
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:52,195
you might want
to keep in mind.

1151
01:40:00,953 --> 01:40:01,913
Go on, now.

1152
01:40:03,289 --> 01:40:04,624
This isn't your house.

1153
01:40:07,585 --> 01:40:08,878
Ain't yours either.

1154
01:40:09,587 --> 01:40:10,880
Come on in here.

1155
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,965
I just got him down.
He'll be quiet.

1156
01:40:21,349 --> 01:40:22,308
Really?

1157
01:40:23,809 --> 01:40:25,061
Over her?

1158
01:40:26,604 --> 01:40:27,939
You want to try this?

1159
01:40:33,819 --> 01:40:35,238
Well, if it meant
that much to you,

1160
01:40:35,238 --> 01:40:36,572
you could have just said
something earlier.

1161
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:42,620
Saved me a long walk up a hill
that I did not enjoy.

1162
01:40:49,877 --> 01:40:50,836
Yeah.

1163
01:40:53,589 --> 01:40:55,508
Yeah, I'll leave
you lovers to it.

1164
01:41:06,185 --> 01:41:08,521
You ain't getting me, boy.
Not you.

1165
01:41:08,521 --> 01:41:09,772
Not in this place.

1166
01:42:05,202 --> 01:42:06,203
You don't know him?

1167
01:42:08,914 --> 01:42:11,083
Well, the woman
who lives here,
maybe she does.

1168
01:42:13,502 --> 01:42:15,296
Whatever they're doing,
you can't be a part of this.

1169
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:18,132
No. They were...

1170
01:42:18,132 --> 01:42:20,468
Walter was just selling off
some land. He...

1171
01:42:20,468 --> 01:42:22,428
No, he was on his way
up here for you.

1172
01:42:22,428 --> 01:42:23,929
However that is,
you got to look

1173
01:42:23,929 --> 01:42:25,431
to yourself right now.
And that child in there.

1174
01:42:31,103 --> 01:42:32,229
Hey!

1175
01:42:35,232 --> 01:42:36,442
There are others with him.

1176
01:42:36,442 --> 01:42:38,569
I don't know
how close they are.

1177
01:42:38,569 --> 01:42:39,987
And when he doesn't come back,

1178
01:42:39,987 --> 01:42:41,697
they'll head here.
You understand that?

1179
01:42:44,325 --> 01:42:46,327
They'll come the way he did.

1180
01:42:46,327 --> 01:42:48,788
No, you don't know that.

1181
01:42:48,788 --> 01:42:52,083
You don't know that.
This doesn't have
anything to do with me.

1182
01:42:52,083 --> 01:42:53,876
You know it doesn't.

1183
01:42:53,876 --> 01:42:56,170
I told you I don't know him.

1184
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:58,130
I don't know either of you.
You did that.

1185
01:42:59,715 --> 01:43:02,009
I'm sorry, Mary.

1186
01:43:02,009 --> 01:43:03,386
You got a little time,
but that's it.

1187
01:43:19,068 --> 01:43:20,111
What happened there?

1188
01:43:21,570 --> 01:43:23,614
I don't know.
There was a fight.

1189
01:43:23,614 --> 01:43:25,533
I didn't... I didn't see.

1190
01:43:32,248 --> 01:43:33,541
You know where you'll go?

1191
01:43:36,669 --> 01:43:37,628
Come on.

1192
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:40,714
You have to take me with you.

1193
01:43:42,049 --> 01:43:43,217
You have to take both of us.

1194
01:43:46,053 --> 01:43:47,012
Please.

1195
01:43:51,517 --> 01:43:52,476
Here.

1196
01:43:53,853 --> 01:43:54,645
Hold him.

1197
01:43:55,646 --> 01:43:57,106
Fine.

1198
01:43:57,106 --> 01:43:59,608
You're gonna need this
where we're going.

1199
01:44:20,629 --> 01:44:21,505
Let's go.

1200
01:45:06,091 --> 01:45:07,510
We just got to keep going.

1201
01:45:20,356 --> 01:45:21,982
Here. Grab that.

1202
01:45:24,235 --> 01:45:25,194
Couple more.

1203
01:45:50,219 --> 01:45:52,763
Son, she's had enough water.

1204
01:45:52,763 --> 01:45:54,765
You can unhitch 'em both.

1205
01:45:54,765 --> 01:45:56,475
They're awful warm, sir.

1206
01:45:56,475 --> 01:45:57,977
Yeah.

1207
01:45:57,977 --> 01:46:00,104
Throw that over 'em.

1208
01:46:00,104 --> 01:46:01,897
Unstrap 'em first, though.

1209
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:06,569
I don't like the looks
of that one.

1210
01:46:06,569 --> 01:46:07,444
Yes, sir.

1211
01:46:10,531 --> 01:46:12,575
He hit something
we didn't, Owen?

1212
01:46:12,575 --> 01:46:16,287
Nah, they say it's this heat.

1213
01:46:21,292 --> 01:46:22,918
It's got everyone's spokes
pulling loose.

1214
01:46:24,670 --> 01:46:26,213
Is that right, Mr. Buckhout?

1215
01:46:26,213 --> 01:46:27,715
Yeah.

1216
01:46:29,675 --> 01:46:31,260
It's still got a good axel.

1217
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:32,511
Yeah.

1218
01:46:32,511 --> 01:46:33,429
All right.

1219
01:46:34,555 --> 01:46:36,765
Well...

1220
01:46:36,765 --> 01:46:39,059
let's get the rest under
that ridge and out of the sun

1221
01:46:39,059 --> 01:46:40,227
before we're fixing them all.

1222
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:44,857
Girls?

1223
01:46:44,857 --> 01:46:46,692
Sorry. If you wouldn't mind...

1224
01:46:47,901 --> 01:46:48,736
Water.

1225
01:46:55,909 --> 01:46:57,161
We'd nearly run out.

1226
01:46:58,162 --> 01:46:59,455
I was about to go begging.

1227
01:46:59,455 --> 01:47:01,540
Darling, water's for them,
I believe.

1228
01:47:03,125 --> 01:47:04,376
Oh.

1229
01:47:04,376 --> 01:47:06,253
I beg your pardon, girls.

1230
01:47:07,504 --> 01:47:09,173
Well,

1231
01:47:09,173 --> 01:47:13,302
let me keep the one for him,
and I'll, um, donate mine.

1232
01:47:13,302 --> 01:47:14,845
How's that?

1233
01:47:14,845 --> 01:47:15,721
Thank you, ma'am.

1234
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:19,600
What are you thanking her for?

1235
01:47:27,483 --> 01:47:28,817
Tighten that wagon up!

1236
01:47:30,402 --> 01:47:31,904
- Owen!
- Tighten the horse down!

1237
01:47:33,572 --> 01:47:34,740
Steady. Steady.

1238
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:36,200
Hey! Hey! Hold it! Hold it!

1239
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:42,956
Cut that goddamned horse out!

1240
01:47:49,088 --> 01:47:50,756
Don't hurt him!

1241
01:47:50,756 --> 01:47:52,466
Stop. You're hurting him.

1242
01:47:52,466 --> 01:47:53,384
Just shut up!

1243
01:47:58,138 --> 01:47:59,932
Lift high!

1244
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:04,395
Let him go!

1245
01:48:09,149 --> 01:48:10,109
Okay, let it down.

1246
01:48:47,604 --> 01:48:49,815
Ma'am. Mr. Proctor.

1247
01:48:51,775 --> 01:48:52,985
See what you got there?

1248
01:48:53,777 --> 01:48:56,238
Oh, afternoon.

1249
01:48:56,238 --> 01:48:59,116
It isn't actually,
um, finished.

1250
01:49:00,576 --> 01:49:01,869
There's an engraver in Raleigh

1251
01:49:01,869 --> 01:49:04,329
who gets these ready
for print.

1252
01:49:04,329 --> 01:49:05,622
He's the real artist,
of course.

1253
01:49:05,622 --> 01:49:07,499
Yeah, I don't see
you in there.

1254
01:49:07,499 --> 01:49:10,043
It does answer
my question though.

1255
01:49:10,043 --> 01:49:11,670
I was about to ask,

1256
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:14,965
did you notice there
were men working down there?

1257
01:49:14,965 --> 01:49:17,134
Oh, yes. Of course. I did.

1258
01:49:20,763 --> 01:49:21,555
Get up.

1259
01:49:23,724 --> 01:49:26,101
Hey! Get up!

1260
01:49:26,101 --> 01:49:27,728
- Excuse me. Ow.
- Get your ass...

1261
01:49:27,728 --> 01:49:29,062
Hey! Hey, that's enough!

1262
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:32,316
Mr. Van Weyden,

1263
01:49:32,316 --> 01:49:35,736
if you want something, you can ask.

1264
01:49:35,736 --> 01:49:37,362
I can?

1265
01:49:37,362 --> 01:49:41,366
All right, here's what I ask...

1266
01:49:41,366 --> 01:49:45,746
When you see men working,
figure out how to help.

1267
01:49:45,746 --> 01:49:49,041
Both of you.
This ain't helping.

1268
01:49:49,041 --> 01:49:51,376
- No. I know.
- Hold on.

1269
01:49:51,376 --> 01:49:54,004
Tomorrow, you be aware
of the time.

1270
01:49:54,004 --> 01:49:56,048
I want you to draw your water

1271
01:49:56,048 --> 01:49:58,509
and get your team hitched
ahead of all these others.

1272
01:49:58,509 --> 01:50:00,761
And don't stop anyone
asking for help.

1273
01:50:00,761 --> 01:50:04,014
Now, if that means you got
to get up a little early,

1274
01:50:04,014 --> 01:50:05,557
go ahead.

1275
01:50:05,557 --> 01:50:07,518
That extra time
you like to take, mornings,

1276
01:50:07,518 --> 01:50:09,144
just you two,

1277
01:50:09,144 --> 01:50:12,231
only means you're dragging
this out for everyone.

1278
01:50:12,231 --> 01:50:14,608
All right. That's fair enough.

1279
01:50:14,608 --> 01:50:16,693
I hope so.

1280
01:50:17,569 --> 01:50:20,280
Now, ma'am...

1281
01:50:22,533 --> 01:50:23,826
is that their cup?

1282
01:50:25,828 --> 01:50:27,496
I'm gonna ask you
to pick it up

1283
01:50:27,496 --> 01:50:28,705
and give it to him.

1284
01:50:29,456 --> 01:50:30,874
Or what?

1285
01:50:30,874 --> 01:50:34,711
You'll start kicking me,
Mr. Van Weyden?

1286
01:50:34,711 --> 01:50:36,004
Maybe you'd like to find out,

1287
01:50:36,004 --> 01:50:37,840
in front of
all these people...

1288
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:40,509
Damn it, Juliette, just learn
when to show some restraint.

1289
01:50:43,345 --> 01:50:44,137
Here we are.

1290
01:50:48,517 --> 01:50:52,187
Uh... All right.
We're all good?

1291
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:58,861
Good. I will go
and offer my services,

1292
01:50:58,861 --> 01:51:00,362
such as they are.

1293
01:51:00,362 --> 01:51:03,407
Captain, Mr. Kittredge,
our apologies.

1294
01:51:07,619 --> 01:51:09,037
You think you've just given us

1295
01:51:09,037 --> 01:51:11,498
a fine bit of education,
don't you?

1296
01:51:11,498 --> 01:51:14,042
I did try, ma'am.

1297
01:51:14,042 --> 01:51:15,961
We'll see if it takes.

1298
01:51:15,961 --> 01:51:18,046
Oh, you keep at it, Captain.

1299
01:51:18,046 --> 01:51:20,340
You'll bring us around.

1300
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:22,718
Like our Mr. Kittredge here.

1301
01:51:22,718 --> 01:51:23,969
He's kicked
and bullied his girls

1302
01:51:23,969 --> 01:51:24,970
into fine young men.

1303
01:51:24,970 --> 01:51:26,805
Young ladies, you meant.

1304
01:51:29,433 --> 01:51:30,726
You know, you're right.

1305
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:32,686
Beg your pardon.

1306
01:51:37,733 --> 01:51:39,067
Owen?

1307
01:51:41,570 --> 01:51:43,196
Would you like me
to talk to her?

1308
01:51:43,196 --> 01:51:44,281
Mm-mm.

1309
01:51:46,742 --> 01:51:49,244
She knows we're girls, Daddy.
She just misspoke.

1310
01:51:49,244 --> 01:51:50,412
Diamond.

1311
01:51:51,455 --> 01:51:52,372
Diamond!

1312
01:52:18,065 --> 01:52:21,109
Oh-ho, that's my girl.

1313
01:52:21,109 --> 01:52:23,570
Okay, we got a good hour now,
and you won't need half that.

1314
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:24,655
Hmm?

1315
01:52:40,671 --> 01:52:44,174
Ah, this is working perfect.

1316
01:52:45,425 --> 01:52:47,219
And, sir,
she does know about this?

1317
01:52:47,219 --> 01:52:48,512
You two talked about it?

1318
01:52:48,512 --> 01:52:50,472
Oh, aye, sure.

1319
01:52:50,472 --> 01:52:52,975
I'll have eyes on her myself,
you know.

1320
01:52:52,975 --> 01:52:54,851
Okay, here you go. Hmm?

1321
01:52:55,936 --> 01:52:57,312
What?

1322
01:52:57,312 --> 01:52:59,564
Just... If she were
to come back, though.

1323
01:52:59,564 --> 01:53:02,359
She is a fierce woman, sir.

1324
01:53:02,359 --> 01:53:05,237
That Mrs. Riordan.
And I mean, no offense.

1325
01:53:05,237 --> 01:53:07,489
Oh, no, no.
No, no. None taken.

1326
01:53:07,489 --> 01:53:09,616
You're right. She's that.

1327
01:53:09,616 --> 01:53:13,787
But, look at us, now.
Three grown men, armed.

1328
01:53:13,787 --> 01:53:17,791
And the heat
slows her down, besides.

1329
01:53:17,791 --> 01:53:19,835
All right, we'll have
no trouble, lads,

1330
01:53:19,835 --> 01:53:21,920
if you work quick. Hmm?

1331
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:25,632
Okay, now, quick.
Go, go. Go. Quick.

1332
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:46,778
Sergeant, if you see any more
K-Company, you send them in.

1333
01:53:46,778 --> 01:53:47,821
Uh, yes, sir.

1334
01:54:20,979 --> 01:54:22,856
You let go of that! Let go!

1335
01:54:22,856 --> 01:54:24,483
Ma'am, stop it.

1336
01:54:24,483 --> 01:54:25,776
Stop it? Come here.

1337
01:54:25,776 --> 01:54:27,861
No. Ouch. Ow.

1338
01:54:27,861 --> 01:54:29,738
Tommy! Look at this.

1339
01:54:29,738 --> 01:54:31,656
I come back
to fetch a hat for Ginny,

1340
01:54:31,656 --> 01:54:34,284
and here's these two
walking out with the furniture.

1341
01:54:36,203 --> 01:54:37,829
Ma'am, please.

1342
01:54:37,829 --> 01:54:40,373
Not a word out of ya. Down!

1343
01:54:40,373 --> 01:54:42,084
They said
that you put 'em up to it.

1344
01:54:42,084 --> 01:54:44,211
Oh, sure he'd steal
his daughter's things,

1345
01:54:44,211 --> 01:54:45,504
out of his own house?

1346
01:54:45,504 --> 01:54:47,923
Ma'am. I...

1347
01:54:47,923 --> 01:54:50,300
Honey, don't!
No! No, no. Enough.

1348
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:53,011
Calm down. All right? Hmm?

1349
01:54:53,011 --> 01:54:55,263
No, no. Stop it. Okay.

1350
01:54:55,263 --> 01:54:56,932
- What is this, Tommy?
- Calm down.

1351
01:54:56,932 --> 01:54:58,934
We can't match force with you.

1352
01:54:58,934 --> 01:55:01,019
But if you let me show you
who this is for,

1353
01:55:01,019 --> 01:55:02,395
I promise you'll understand.

1354
01:55:02,395 --> 01:55:03,730
Will you let me do that?

1355
01:55:05,148 --> 01:55:06,316
- Yeah.
- Yeah? You'll let me?

1356
01:55:06,316 --> 01:55:09,277
All right.

1357
01:55:09,277 --> 01:55:10,445
Enough of this.

1358
01:55:12,322 --> 01:55:13,448
I'll be right back.

1359
01:56:02,205 --> 01:56:03,123
Ma'am.

1360
01:56:05,458 --> 01:56:08,712
Good afternoon.
Afternoon, Sergeant.

1361
01:56:08,712 --> 01:56:10,046
Out of the sun, Lizzie.

1362
01:56:12,132 --> 01:56:14,092
Miss Frances,
Miss Elizabeth...

1363
01:56:15,385 --> 01:56:16,803
this is Mrs. Riordan.

1364
01:56:16,803 --> 01:56:19,514
Mother, the Ladies Kittredge.

1365
01:56:24,352 --> 01:56:28,023
You ought to have said, Tommy.
What an angel.

1366
01:56:31,902 --> 01:56:34,029
You give that to me.

1367
01:56:34,029 --> 01:56:35,989
These hands in Army soap.

1368
01:56:39,367 --> 01:56:41,119
You ought to have told me,
Tommy.

1369
01:56:51,755 --> 01:56:53,673
There's our own little Rose,
you see.

1370
01:56:55,342 --> 01:56:57,510
Last of our six.

1371
01:56:57,510 --> 01:56:59,930
- Oh, she's beautiful.
- Mm-hm.

1372
01:56:59,930 --> 01:57:02,682
And fair, like your Lizzie.

1373
01:57:04,434 --> 01:57:06,353
About her age, too,
when our Father

1374
01:57:06,353 --> 01:57:08,355
called her back up
to his side.

1375
01:57:10,523 --> 01:57:11,983
Suppose He couldn't
bear the loss

1376
01:57:11,983 --> 01:57:13,860
any better than we did. Hmm?

1377
01:57:19,574 --> 01:57:21,243
Sorry for your loss, Miss.

1378
01:57:22,786 --> 01:57:23,828
And yours.

1379
01:57:29,834 --> 01:57:34,339
Anyway, you've met
the Mrs. Riordan.

1380
01:57:34,339 --> 01:57:36,216
You'll want no more
protection or provision

1381
01:57:36,216 --> 01:57:37,550
now that you're here.

1382
01:58:12,752 --> 01:58:13,628
Hugh.

1383
01:58:19,092 --> 01:58:21,761
Look at that!

1384
01:58:21,761 --> 01:58:23,680
Oh, they're magnificent.

1385
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:25,682
I don't think we've ever
seen them this close.

1386
01:58:26,975 --> 01:58:27,976
Let me get your book.

1387
01:58:30,478 --> 01:58:33,440
No, no. I want us
just to look at this.

1388
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:34,482
Okay.

1389
01:58:39,863 --> 01:58:41,865
What do you want to do?

1390
01:58:41,865 --> 01:58:43,616
About that scout up there,
you mean?

1391
01:58:43,616 --> 01:58:46,286
Well, now there's two.

1392
01:58:52,375 --> 01:58:53,460
Lovely.

1393
01:59:01,509 --> 01:59:03,678
Steady there, Daniel.
Just keep moving.

1394
01:59:03,678 --> 01:59:04,804
We're all right.

1395
01:59:13,271 --> 01:59:14,773
Don't seem to mind
that we're looking.

1396
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:19,861
Probably wants to see
how many we are,

1397
01:59:19,861 --> 01:59:23,031
see how far we get today,
and where we stop.

1398
01:59:25,367 --> 01:59:27,452
All right,
when this opens up,

1399
01:59:27,452 --> 01:59:28,745
I'm gonna have you run

1400
01:59:28,745 --> 01:59:30,038
the lead wagon
round to the back,

1401
01:59:30,038 --> 01:59:31,956
draw us all up in a ring.

1402
01:59:31,956 --> 01:59:35,126
We'll keep the animals
inside tonight. All right?

1403
01:59:45,845 --> 01:59:47,680
There you are.

1404
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:49,933
All right, darlin'.
Time for bed.

1405
01:59:54,521 --> 01:59:55,355
Good night.

1406
02:00:03,029 --> 02:00:04,906
All right, just hold on.

1407
02:00:04,906 --> 02:00:06,991
What I know is,

1408
02:00:06,991 --> 02:00:09,828
we said we wouldn't
pay tolls to anyone.

1409
02:00:09,828 --> 02:00:13,498
If you want to hold another
vote in the morning, we can.

1410
02:00:13,498 --> 02:00:17,127
But for now, you just keep
your eyes open, all right?

1411
02:00:17,127 --> 02:00:19,754
And don't expect
to see Napoleon's army.

1412
02:00:19,754 --> 02:00:21,256
If they come,
it'll be just a few

1413
02:00:21,256 --> 02:00:23,383
trying to stampede
the animals.

1414
02:00:23,383 --> 02:00:26,845
Might stampede on their own,
boxed in like this.

1415
02:00:26,845 --> 02:00:29,431
Yeah, there's always
that chance.

1416
02:00:29,431 --> 02:00:31,057
And if anybody
wants to stay up,

1417
02:00:31,057 --> 02:00:33,935
keep an eye on his property,
I'd understand that.

1418
02:00:33,935 --> 02:00:37,355
Just know we start
14 more hours in the morning.

1419
02:00:37,355 --> 02:00:40,024
And we'll do 14 more
after that.

1420
02:00:40,024 --> 02:00:41,734
That's our preservation.

1421
02:00:42,902 --> 02:00:44,404
Keeping that pace.

1422
02:03:03,918 --> 02:03:04,794
Hugh?

1423
02:03:05,670 --> 02:03:07,380
Hugh?

1424
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:10,508
They were talking
like it's Apaches, Matthew.

1425
02:03:10,508 --> 02:03:12,468
It's not.

1426
02:03:12,468 --> 02:03:16,055
We're not in that country yet.
All right?

1427
02:03:16,055 --> 02:03:18,600
Well, what about Chiricahuas?

1428
02:03:18,600 --> 02:03:23,271
That's just another kind
of Apache. So, again, no.

1429
02:03:23,271 --> 02:03:26,441
What books are you reading,
Virgil?

1430
02:03:31,154 --> 02:03:32,655
You're just scaring yourself.

1431
02:03:47,337 --> 02:03:48,963
Help you with something,
Mr. Proctor?

1432
02:03:53,134 --> 02:03:55,094
And she's sure it was those two?

1433
02:03:55,094 --> 02:03:56,429
Yes.

1434
02:03:56,429 --> 02:03:59,223
Yeah, it would be.

1435
02:03:59,223 --> 02:04:01,434
And you wouldn't just talk
to them yourself?

1436
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:03,519
Well, I wasn't sure,

1437
02:04:03,519 --> 02:04:04,604
this being
a disciplinary issue,

1438
02:04:04,604 --> 02:04:05,521
I thought that you'd be the...

1439
02:04:05,521 --> 02:04:06,564
No, I don't blame you.

1440
02:04:08,483 --> 02:04:09,400
All right.

1441
02:04:11,653 --> 02:04:13,237
What about your wife?

1442
02:04:13,237 --> 02:04:15,281
You're not afraid
to talk to her, are you?

1443
02:04:16,449 --> 02:04:18,951
No, not usually.

1444
02:04:18,951 --> 02:04:22,830
You tell her why is she
bathing in the drinking water?

1445
02:04:22,830 --> 02:04:24,499
Oh, well,
I think she thought that

1446
02:04:24,499 --> 02:04:26,000
as long as it was ours,
then there was no...

1447
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,504
But it's not yours.
You're just carrying it.

1448
02:04:31,005 --> 02:04:34,217
You know when we hit
water next? Barring rain?

1449
02:04:34,217 --> 02:04:35,426
No.

1450
02:04:35,426 --> 02:04:38,262
No, you don't.
And neither do I.

1451
02:04:38,262 --> 02:04:40,473
But there's desert ahead.

1452
02:04:40,473 --> 02:04:42,684
Means there may come a time
when we draw straws

1453
02:04:42,684 --> 02:04:44,143
for the last of the water,

1454
02:04:44,143 --> 02:04:46,521
and maybe
you don't get a straw.

1455
02:04:46,521 --> 02:04:48,022
You tell her that.

1456
02:04:49,232 --> 02:04:51,192
Listen to me.

1457
02:04:51,192 --> 02:04:55,071
You watch how and when
the others bathe.

1458
02:04:55,071 --> 02:04:57,907
All right? You do like them.

1459
02:04:57,907 --> 02:05:00,702
We will, sir. And I'll
tell her. And you'll...

1460
02:05:02,453 --> 02:05:04,414
And I'll talk to those men.

1461
02:05:05,832 --> 02:05:06,791
Thank you.

1462
02:05:31,149 --> 02:05:32,108
Gentlemen?

1463
02:05:34,610 --> 02:05:37,905
I understand there was a lady
bathing outside that wagon

1464
02:05:37,905 --> 02:05:40,074
earlier tonight?

1465
02:05:40,074 --> 02:05:42,493
Understand you two
got a pretty good look at her.

1466
02:05:43,494 --> 02:05:44,620
Is that right?

1467
02:05:45,747 --> 02:05:48,040
Sounds like gossip.

1468
02:05:48,040 --> 02:05:50,334
Well, I wasn't here,
so I can't say,

1469
02:05:50,334 --> 02:05:53,963
but I do know
when complaints are made,

1470
02:05:53,963 --> 02:05:55,590
I'm the one
that's got to hear 'em.

1471
02:05:55,590 --> 02:05:57,592
Did we vote this man captain?

1472
02:05:58,801 --> 02:06:01,304
You 'member?

1473
02:06:01,304 --> 02:06:04,599
Well, enough others did, Sig,
that it's become my job.

1474
02:06:14,233 --> 02:06:16,068
You two, listen,

1475
02:06:16,068 --> 02:06:17,737
you've been
a help to me, so far.

1476
02:06:17,737 --> 02:06:19,739
Looking after the stock.

1477
02:06:19,739 --> 02:06:21,908
I got no problem
with you, myself.

1478
02:06:21,908 --> 02:06:24,160
But if somebody else does...

1479
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:26,788
I do have to take that
into account.

1480
02:06:26,788 --> 02:06:29,332
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1481
02:06:30,625 --> 02:06:32,210
Beg your pardon?

1482
02:06:32,210 --> 02:06:34,879
He said,
I guess when some fool lady

1483
02:06:34,879 --> 02:06:37,673
wants to undress
out in the open...

1484
02:06:37,673 --> 02:06:40,134
we're better off throwing
an apron over our head

1485
02:06:40,134 --> 02:06:42,136
and turning ourself
in to the law.

1486
02:06:43,471 --> 02:06:44,639
Is that right?

1487
02:06:47,767 --> 02:06:49,060
I don't think
that's what I'm saying,

1488
02:06:49,060 --> 02:06:50,353
and I think you know that.

1489
02:06:50,353 --> 02:06:51,646
No, you don't think.

1490
02:06:53,272 --> 02:06:54,106
Do you?

1491
02:06:57,944 --> 02:06:59,695
That might be your problem
right there.

1492
02:07:01,697 --> 02:07:05,910
Now, you can sit here, Captain,
listen to our side...

1493
02:07:05,910 --> 02:07:08,287
maybe figure out
who you're trying to scold.

1494
02:07:11,290 --> 02:07:13,501
But you know,
from the look of you,

1495
02:07:13,501 --> 02:07:16,128
I think you'd rather just get.

1496
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:26,430
Just...

1497
02:07:26,430 --> 02:07:29,809
just steer clear of that woman
and her husband, is all.

1498
02:07:29,809 --> 02:07:32,061
It's a worry
I don't goddamned need.

1499
02:07:37,191 --> 02:07:38,651
Yep.

1500
02:07:38,651 --> 02:07:40,236
And there he goes.

1501
02:08:10,224 --> 02:08:11,434
Did you get her boy?

1502
02:08:13,561 --> 02:08:14,478
No.

1503
02:08:15,521 --> 02:08:16,480
Good.

1504
02:08:17,690 --> 02:08:19,358
It's not welcome here.

1505
02:08:30,202 --> 02:08:31,662
Bring him inside.

1506
02:08:31,662 --> 02:08:33,080
But they haven't ate yet.

1507
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:34,749
It's okay.

1508
02:08:34,749 --> 02:08:36,208
- You haven't ate.
- Take this.

1509
02:08:37,251 --> 02:08:38,586
Go on. It's okay.

1510
02:08:56,604 --> 02:08:57,855
Were you with him?

1511
02:09:03,277 --> 02:09:04,445
You oughtta been.

1512
02:09:06,030 --> 02:09:07,114
That's your brother.

1513
02:09:10,618 --> 02:09:11,827
Yeah, I see that...

1514
02:09:13,579 --> 02:09:15,289
I see that as a mistake.

1515
02:09:20,753 --> 02:09:22,338
Who was it, did this?

1516
02:09:23,923 --> 02:09:25,800
Saddle tramp.
We didn't know him.

1517
02:09:27,677 --> 02:09:28,844
Get his name?

1518
02:09:29,887 --> 02:09:30,930
I did.

1519
02:09:35,393 --> 02:09:38,187
Hayes Ellison.

1520
02:09:38,187 --> 02:09:40,439
We know his looks,
and his horse and kit.

1521
02:09:42,108 --> 02:09:44,485
Clerk said he's got family
around Council Grove,

1522
02:09:44,485 --> 02:09:46,404
so I sent Mike
and two others that way.

1523
02:09:53,786 --> 02:09:55,746
Your mother told you
to take him inside.

1524
02:10:06,215 --> 02:10:07,675
Hayes,
what are you looking at?

1525
02:10:11,554 --> 02:10:13,389
Honey,
there's nobody following us.

1526
02:10:28,237 --> 02:10:29,989
Come on, get it.

1527
02:10:29,989 --> 02:10:32,158
Come on and get it.
Get it. Get it.

1528
02:10:33,993 --> 02:10:35,745
This is from me to you.

1529
02:10:35,745 --> 02:10:39,248
No charge, sabbe. No charge.

1530
02:10:42,209 --> 02:10:44,754
Burns a bit, huh?
But it's good.

1531
02:10:44,754 --> 02:10:45,796
Get it.

1532
02:10:50,968 --> 02:10:52,053
Abel!

1533
02:10:53,679 --> 02:10:55,181
You wait here, chief.

1534
02:10:56,807 --> 02:10:58,601
Don't touch that.

1535
02:10:58,601 --> 02:10:59,894
Ain't yours yet.

1536
02:11:05,816 --> 02:11:06,776
See this?

1537
02:11:08,110 --> 02:11:11,155
I could if you moved
that fat head.

1538
02:11:11,155 --> 02:11:12,615
That makes six or seven of them.

1539
02:11:13,991 --> 02:11:15,910
Probably pretty well-armed.

1540
02:11:15,910 --> 02:11:17,411
Why wouldn't they be?

1541
02:11:23,250 --> 02:11:25,002
This is gonna make my week.

1542
02:11:52,071 --> 02:11:54,698
You must see enough in here
to do a trade with 'em.

1543
02:11:54,698 --> 02:11:57,201
Yeah, well, I manage anyhow.

1544
02:11:57,201 --> 02:11:59,245
Well, I'd like to know
where they all go

1545
02:11:59,245 --> 02:12:00,412
when they ain't here.

1546
02:12:00,412 --> 02:12:01,705
Might be looking on the moon,

1547
02:12:01,705 --> 02:12:03,541
for all the sign
we found out there.

1548
02:12:03,541 --> 02:12:06,335
Well, I suggest
you just sit still

1549
02:12:06,335 --> 02:12:08,754
and let them come to you.

1550
02:12:09,797 --> 02:12:11,507
Yeah, we tried that once.

1551
02:12:11,507 --> 02:12:13,008
I prefer to stay moving.

1552
02:12:19,974 --> 02:12:23,853
Son, I got black licorice
all the way from St. Louis.

1553
02:12:23,853 --> 02:12:24,854
Right under here.

1554
02:12:26,438 --> 02:12:27,439
I'll have a look
at one of those.

1555
02:12:30,109 --> 02:12:31,652
Those?

1556
02:12:31,652 --> 02:12:36,365
Those are J.H. Dance 44's.

1557
02:12:36,365 --> 02:12:38,909
And I think you can see them
fine from where you are.

1558
02:12:40,411 --> 02:12:41,453
I'll have one.

1559
02:12:41,453 --> 02:12:42,705
You'll have one?

1560
02:12:46,208 --> 02:12:48,711
You're hardly out of
short pants, ain't you?

1561
02:12:50,379 --> 02:12:52,673
He's fine. He'll grow into it.

1562
02:12:53,924 --> 02:12:56,635
Boss, he says he's leaving.

1563
02:12:56,635 --> 02:12:59,471
Chief, just hold your ass.
I'll buy you another drink.

1564
02:13:01,807 --> 02:13:02,725
Well, I'll tell you...

1565
02:13:06,854 --> 02:13:08,230
These are a match set,

1566
02:13:08,230 --> 02:13:12,193
and I couldn't
sell them separate.

1567
02:13:12,193 --> 02:13:14,028
Tell him. It's his money.

1568
02:13:18,616 --> 02:13:20,284
All right, then.

1569
02:13:20,284 --> 02:13:22,661
He'll probably
want to try 'em first.

1570
02:13:22,661 --> 02:13:26,540
Fine. You take it outside,
and he pays for the bullets.

1571
02:13:37,259 --> 02:13:40,095
Boss, he says if you don't
sell him anything,

1572
02:13:40,095 --> 02:13:42,389
he's gonna take his
smelly antelope and leave.

1573
02:13:42,389 --> 02:13:43,766
Get him the hell out of here.

1574
02:13:46,435 --> 02:13:50,147
I take them in,
these goddamn Indians.

1575
02:13:50,147 --> 02:13:53,317
He comes in here and drags
that thing across my floor.

1576
02:13:53,317 --> 02:13:55,319
Drinks my liquor for free.

1577
02:13:55,319 --> 02:13:57,863
And then
he doesn't want to trade.

1578
02:13:57,863 --> 02:13:59,615
Maybe he don't trust
your scales.

1579
02:14:05,704 --> 02:14:06,914
Hold on, there.

1580
02:14:13,963 --> 02:14:15,798
Someone drag
that carcass out of here.

1581
02:14:22,179 --> 02:14:23,347
I'll trade with you.

1582
02:14:26,350 --> 02:14:27,268
Russell!

1583
02:14:29,937 --> 02:14:32,481
Have a look at this here buck.

1584
02:14:32,481 --> 02:14:34,566
He just might be the one
who killed your folks.

1585
02:14:39,363 --> 02:14:40,572
You never know.

1586
02:14:41,490 --> 02:14:42,866
Pionsenay.

1587
02:14:44,702 --> 02:14:47,162
I think the Mexicans call him "Puno."

1588
02:14:47,162 --> 02:14:48,998
- You know him?
- Mm-mm.

1589
02:14:57,798 --> 02:14:58,757
Give it to him.

1590
02:15:13,480 --> 02:15:14,940
How's that feel?
Too heavy for you?

1591
02:15:18,527 --> 02:15:19,653
- Russell.
- I'm all right.

1592
02:15:19,653 --> 02:15:20,779
What's this?

1593
02:15:20,779 --> 02:15:22,448
You just watch, Elias.

1594
02:15:23,574 --> 02:15:24,950
You weren't here
when it started.

1595
02:15:30,414 --> 02:15:32,249
You think you can
get that out before him?

1596
02:15:41,508 --> 02:15:42,926
See if you can get
both of them.

1597
02:15:42,926 --> 02:15:44,386
Oh, no,
I'm not having this in here.

1598
02:15:44,386 --> 02:15:45,721
You take this outside.

1599
02:15:48,182 --> 02:15:50,017
You're all right.

1600
02:15:50,017 --> 02:15:51,810
Stay still.

1601
02:15:51,810 --> 02:15:53,479
This is a game.

1602
02:15:53,479 --> 02:15:55,647
You're gonna draw this kid for his shells.

1603
02:15:55,647 --> 02:15:56,982
Against your antelope.

1604
02:15:57,983 --> 02:15:59,818
That sound fair to you?

1605
02:15:59,818 --> 02:16:01,612
He doesn't understand.

1606
02:16:01,612 --> 02:16:03,280
Oh, yes, he does.

1607
02:16:04,656 --> 02:16:06,617
He just wants
another bullet is all.

1608
02:16:07,910 --> 02:16:09,244
Look at that face.

1609
02:16:13,624 --> 02:16:15,667
Go outside.

1610
02:16:15,667 --> 02:16:17,002
That's right, boys.

1611
02:16:17,002 --> 02:16:18,170
Give him some room.

1612
02:16:21,715 --> 02:16:23,967
Don't move.

1613
02:16:23,967 --> 02:16:25,177
They're almost done.

1614
02:17:05,217 --> 02:17:06,135
No.

1615
02:17:07,719 --> 02:17:09,054
I'm done.

1616
02:17:13,851 --> 02:17:14,685
Go on.

1617
02:17:18,856 --> 02:17:19,982
Is that his?

1618
02:17:19,982 --> 02:17:21,233
- Yeah.
- Give it to him.

1619
02:17:27,573 --> 02:17:28,824
We're all done in here.

1620
02:17:31,952 --> 02:17:33,579
He said that's enough.

1621
02:17:44,381 --> 02:17:46,383
You still want those?

1622
02:17:46,383 --> 02:17:47,676
They're paid for.

1623
02:18:05,694 --> 02:18:06,904
How you know it's them?

1624
02:18:07,863 --> 02:18:09,072
I don't.

1625
02:18:09,072 --> 02:18:10,491
I just had a feeling
I felt something

1626
02:18:10,491 --> 02:18:12,201
behind us for a while now.

1627
02:18:13,952 --> 02:18:16,914
I have to ride down there
and see.

1628
02:18:16,914 --> 02:18:19,416
I'd like to see how they're
working, too, if it is them.

1629
02:18:41,563 --> 02:18:44,942
Hayes, there's a whole world
we could go to. You know?

1630
02:18:44,942 --> 02:18:46,735
Nothing says
we gotta go down there.

1631
02:18:49,196 --> 02:18:51,448
We have to feed him.
And I'd like to...

1632
02:18:58,038 --> 02:19:00,958
and I'd like to earn
something too. So, then...

1633
02:19:00,958 --> 02:19:04,753
Yeah, after that, anywhere.
You just... you just pick.

1634
02:19:15,931 --> 02:19:19,017
It's a place
we can risk anyway...

1635
02:19:19,017 --> 02:19:21,853
if they just satisfied
themselves we're not there.

1636
02:19:24,565 --> 02:19:27,985
I could just
catch up with them. Hmm?

1637
02:19:27,985 --> 02:19:31,321
I'll tell 'em who I am
and I'll tell 'em I quit.

1638
02:19:31,321 --> 02:19:32,823
And say you left us
in Bountiful.

1639
02:19:32,823 --> 02:19:34,908
I heard you saying something
about California.

1640
02:19:35,993 --> 02:19:37,536
Yeah.

1641
02:19:37,536 --> 02:19:38,704
They'll probably
just thank you

1642
02:19:38,704 --> 02:19:40,247
and send you along, huh?

1643
02:19:42,082 --> 02:19:43,417
They could do their worst
at this point.

1644
02:19:45,502 --> 02:19:47,671
All they know about me is
I was looking after him

1645
02:19:47,671 --> 02:19:48,964
the night they came.

1646
02:19:48,964 --> 02:19:51,341
That's all I am
in any of this.

1647
02:19:51,341 --> 02:19:54,177
Why do you think
they'd even bother?

1648
02:19:54,177 --> 02:19:55,679
You could ask Walter
about that.

1649
02:19:55,679 --> 02:19:57,556
Well, I might.

1650
02:19:57,556 --> 02:19:59,182
You don't know
what happened to them.

1651
02:19:59,182 --> 02:20:00,892
You're not taking the full
measure of this, Mary.

1652
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:05,188
Think about how far
these men just came

1653
02:20:05,188 --> 02:20:07,691
and how long they've been
at it over one old injury.

1654
02:20:09,818 --> 02:20:11,361
I know the man I met
was on his way

1655
02:20:11,361 --> 02:20:12,654
to kill everyone
in that house.

1656
02:20:12,654 --> 02:20:14,823
He might as well
have been walking up

1657
02:20:14,823 --> 02:20:16,908
to get the mail
for all it bothered him.

1658
02:20:18,910 --> 02:20:20,370
Now they had a second loss

1659
02:20:20,370 --> 02:20:22,247
and they're this much farther
out of their way.

1660
02:20:25,751 --> 02:20:28,170
I can't imagine they'll be any
kinder to you this time.

1661
02:20:30,589 --> 02:20:32,382
So, they'll just kill me then.

1662
02:20:32,382 --> 02:20:34,217
Right out
in front of everyone.

1663
02:20:34,217 --> 02:20:36,637
No, they'll probably take you
somewhere quiet, won't they?

1664
02:20:44,645 --> 02:20:45,896
We'll stay up here tonight.

1665
02:20:47,731 --> 02:20:48,565
One more.

1666
02:20:49,399 --> 02:20:50,776
Just to be sure.

1667
02:20:50,776 --> 02:20:53,195
Uh-huh. Just to be sure.

1668
02:20:53,195 --> 02:20:56,406
So we'll sleep up here.
On the ground.

1669
02:20:56,406 --> 02:20:58,116
Or in the rain maybe.

1670
02:20:58,116 --> 02:20:59,618
I wish you told me you were
this funny when we met.

1671
02:21:02,204 --> 02:21:03,246
Yeah, I shoulda.

1672
02:21:08,752 --> 02:21:10,754
We can risk a fire, anyway.

1673
02:21:10,754 --> 02:21:12,047
Ooh, a fire.

1674
02:21:23,934 --> 02:21:25,060
Tomorrow, I'll...

1675
02:21:26,978 --> 02:21:28,647
I'll ride down there
and see what they want

1676
02:21:28,647 --> 02:21:29,940
for one of those tents.

1677
02:21:31,400 --> 02:21:32,484
So just one more night,

1678
02:21:32,484 --> 02:21:34,152
and then all the comforts
of home.

1679
02:21:43,787 --> 02:21:47,290
I'm sorry.
Honey, I'm... I'm ratty today.

1680
02:21:48,333 --> 02:21:50,085
Don't listen to me.

1681
02:21:50,085 --> 02:21:51,420
We're gonna do what you say.

1682
02:21:51,420 --> 02:21:52,337
And of course,
I know you're right.

1683
02:21:52,337 --> 02:21:53,296
You believe me?

1684
02:21:54,965 --> 02:21:56,299
Just wait
till I got cleaned up

1685
02:21:56,299 --> 02:21:58,260
and I had some sleep.
I'll be better.

1686
02:22:00,470 --> 02:22:01,430
You're fine.

1687
02:22:58,653 --> 02:22:59,613
Ma'am.

1688
02:23:00,739 --> 02:23:02,115
Aw.

1689
02:23:02,115 --> 02:23:05,285
I'm gonna go pop me
General Jackson for you.

1690
02:23:05,285 --> 02:23:07,662
We'll be back
for spring formal.

1691
02:23:07,662 --> 02:23:09,873
Have a chest full of ribbons,
then, too.

1692
02:23:11,333 --> 02:23:13,460
And I'll let you have one.

1693
02:23:13,460 --> 02:23:14,961
How's that?

1694
02:23:14,961 --> 02:23:16,546
Sergeant says that the sight of us

1695
02:23:16,546 --> 02:23:18,215
is only gonna encourage
enemies of the union.

1696
02:23:20,300 --> 02:23:22,093
Sorry...

1697
02:23:22,093 --> 02:23:25,138
we're just learning how you
young men can get called away.

1698
02:23:26,348 --> 02:23:27,849
But that you do come back.

1699
02:23:27,849 --> 02:23:30,310
Of course we do, honey.

1700
02:23:31,186 --> 02:23:32,521
Only at higher pay.

1701
02:23:35,524 --> 02:23:37,567
Oh, Lizzie, wait.

1702
02:23:37,567 --> 02:23:38,777
It's all right, ma'am.

1703
02:23:38,777 --> 02:23:39,903
We understand.

1704
02:23:41,363 --> 02:23:42,322
Anyhow, Lizzie...

1705
02:23:44,658 --> 02:23:46,243
you be a help to your mom.

1706
02:23:52,541 --> 02:23:53,959
We'll be hearing about you.

1707
02:24:00,632 --> 02:24:01,508
Ma'am.

1708
02:24:21,862 --> 02:24:22,779
Well, what we got here?

1709
02:24:24,197 --> 02:24:25,699
Well...

1710
02:24:25,699 --> 02:24:27,075
Would you look at this?

1711
02:24:29,077 --> 02:24:30,287
Now, ain't this good luck?

1712
02:24:32,706 --> 02:24:34,332
That's awful nice of you,
Lizzie.

1713
02:24:41,923 --> 02:24:44,009
I'm gonna bring this back
to you, sweetheart.

1714
02:24:45,802 --> 02:24:46,928
I promise you.

1715
02:24:49,097 --> 02:24:50,223
Oh...

1716
02:24:52,684 --> 02:24:55,645
Don't know if there's more of
where she got those, ma'am?

1717
02:24:55,645 --> 02:24:59,816
But if Lizzie could find some
for these other boys...

1718
02:24:59,816 --> 02:25:02,110
you can see yourself
what it'd mean.

1719
02:25:02,110 --> 02:25:03,695
Of course.

1720
02:25:03,695 --> 02:25:05,488
I'm sorry. I should have
seen that myself.

1721
02:25:07,449 --> 02:25:08,241
Lizzie?

1722
02:25:20,253 --> 02:25:23,840
None of 'em will admit to
the fear of not having one...

1723
02:25:23,840 --> 02:25:26,885
but often enough it's trifles
like these they march for.

1724
02:25:28,053 --> 02:25:30,597
That bit of cloth, to them...

1725
02:25:30,597 --> 02:25:32,766
that's your
daughter's blessing.

1726
02:25:32,766 --> 02:25:34,392
And you'll see,

1727
02:25:34,392 --> 02:25:36,353
more than one
will die holding it.

1728
02:25:37,771 --> 02:25:39,272
It'll be that dear to them.

1729
02:26:14,057 --> 02:26:15,350
You wish
you were going with 'em?

1730
02:26:17,352 --> 02:26:19,562
They start drawing
an active wage, anyhow.

1731
02:26:21,439 --> 02:26:23,900
You know, the work we do
out here, Trent, it's...

1732
02:26:23,900 --> 02:26:26,152
it's no kind of spectacle.

1733
02:26:26,152 --> 02:26:28,613
That doesn't make it
any less important.

1734
02:26:28,613 --> 02:26:31,074
It might not be easy for you
to see that, just now.

1735
02:27:00,478 --> 02:27:02,731
Oh no, baby, that's hot.

1736
02:27:02,731 --> 02:27:04,190
That's hot.
You don't touch that.

1737
02:27:04,190 --> 02:27:06,234
Okay? What's that?

1738
02:27:06,234 --> 02:27:07,235
Huh?

1739
02:27:07,986 --> 02:27:09,279
What is this?

1740
02:27:11,906 --> 02:27:13,658
A cigar cutter?

1741
02:27:13,658 --> 02:27:15,785
This is sharp!

1742
02:27:15,785 --> 02:27:18,163
You'd like Hayes
to find that, I guess?

1743
02:27:18,163 --> 02:27:20,623
What? You worry
he'll throw you out?

1744
02:27:20,623 --> 02:27:23,209
Hey, maybe
I'll leave it then. Huh?

1745
02:27:23,209 --> 02:27:25,378
As a favor to you.

1746
02:27:25,378 --> 02:27:27,213
You don't seem able
to move on your own.

1747
02:27:28,089 --> 02:27:29,049
I will.

1748
02:27:30,133 --> 02:27:31,634
Yeah, you said.

1749
02:27:31,634 --> 02:27:34,971
I don't know. I, uh, begin
to have my doubts.

1750
02:27:34,971 --> 02:27:36,431
You're not gonna touch this.
Okay?

1751
02:27:36,431 --> 02:27:39,059
That's hot.
You play with this ball.

1752
02:27:39,059 --> 02:27:40,727
Or maybe you really started
to see yourself

1753
02:27:40,727 --> 02:27:43,521
as that boy's mother now, huh?

1754
02:27:43,521 --> 02:27:46,566
Yeah, well,
don't you worry about that.

1755
02:27:46,566 --> 02:27:48,526
'Cause he ain't fooled.
Believe me.

1756
02:27:51,488 --> 02:27:53,073
What?

1757
02:27:53,073 --> 02:27:56,534
Hey, you remind yourself of
anyone's mother you know?

1758
02:27:56,534 --> 02:27:57,744
And how do you think Hayes

1759
02:27:57,744 --> 02:27:58,995
would work out
as a father, huh?

1760
02:27:58,995 --> 02:28:00,497
You think he asked
for any of this?

1761
02:28:01,664 --> 02:28:02,916
I don't know.

1762
02:28:02,916 --> 02:28:06,252
He'd try, anyway. Maybe.

1763
02:28:06,252 --> 02:28:08,755
He'll be better off, trust me.

1764
02:28:11,216 --> 02:28:13,218
Well, if it ain't for Hayes,

1765
02:28:13,218 --> 02:28:15,929
I don't know
what we're doing here, honey.

1766
02:28:19,140 --> 02:28:20,016
Is it?

1767
02:28:22,602 --> 02:28:25,688
Hell, I do not see a problem
in leaving a man like that.

1768
02:28:25,688 --> 02:28:27,649
Like what?

1769
02:28:27,649 --> 02:28:28,983
He's the only
decent person in this.

1770
02:28:28,983 --> 02:28:30,610
You don't know a damn thing.

1771
02:28:30,610 --> 02:28:32,654
Aw, ain't you decent?

1772
02:28:33,696 --> 02:28:35,156
I'm good enough for you.

1773
02:28:36,908 --> 02:28:37,992
All right.

1774
02:28:37,992 --> 02:28:40,745
I'm just saying, we gotta go.

1775
02:28:40,745 --> 02:28:42,872
If I stay any longer...

1776
02:28:42,872 --> 02:28:44,666
Christ, I might have
to find a job here.

1777
02:28:46,251 --> 02:28:48,044
And that'd just about
kill you, I guess.

1778
02:28:55,927 --> 02:28:57,637
I think I've dawdled here
long enough.

1779
02:29:00,849 --> 02:29:02,350
Just let me figure this out.

1780
02:29:06,688 --> 02:29:09,691
Tomorrow, honey.
You see if I'm kidding.

1781
02:29:27,292 --> 02:29:28,293
Oh!

1782
02:29:28,293 --> 02:29:30,753
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1783
02:29:30,753 --> 02:29:33,548
I'm so sorry.
He wanted to see the donkey.

1784
02:29:33,548 --> 02:29:36,009
The donkey, I think.

1785
02:29:36,009 --> 02:29:38,011
Oh, he can pat.

1786
02:29:38,011 --> 02:29:39,179
Pat the donkey. Yeah.

1787
02:29:39,179 --> 02:29:41,181
Thank you. Thank you.

1788
02:29:47,187 --> 02:29:48,521
All right, everybody out.

1789
02:29:51,065 --> 02:29:52,859
Tomorrow he only wants ten,
he said.

1790
02:29:52,859 --> 02:29:56,154
So I need the first ten of you
lined up here, ready to work.

1791
02:29:57,780 --> 02:29:59,824
English speakers only.
You understand that?

1792
02:30:01,159 --> 02:30:03,077
He don't want no more Chinese.

1793
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:08,124
Somebody needs to tell them
he don't want no more.

1794
02:30:08,124 --> 02:30:09,542
No more Chinese.

1795
02:30:09,542 --> 02:30:11,711
That's right. No more Chinese.

1796
02:30:11,711 --> 02:30:13,671
English speakers only.

1797
02:30:13,671 --> 02:30:14,714
Let's go. Hup.

1798
02:30:51,876 --> 02:30:53,795
You were right.

1799
02:30:53,795 --> 02:30:56,589
It was Ruiz and that German.

1800
02:30:56,589 --> 02:30:58,216
- Mr. Strauss?
- Yeah.

1801
02:30:58,216 --> 02:31:00,718
We lost them before we come
through that notch.

1802
02:31:00,718 --> 02:31:02,470
Told Ned they was tired.

1803
02:31:02,470 --> 02:31:03,513
All right.

1804
02:31:04,722 --> 02:31:06,057
It wasn't their cause anyway.

1805
02:31:06,057 --> 02:31:07,475
I don't know. Makes you wonder

1806
02:31:07,475 --> 02:31:10,395
when we'll be too few
to continue.

1807
02:31:10,395 --> 02:31:12,230
What about your six?

1808
02:31:12,230 --> 02:31:13,982
Looks like you're about to
become our majority.

1809
02:31:13,982 --> 02:31:16,609
Well, I'll be honest with you,

1810
02:31:16,609 --> 02:31:19,153
they'd like to see
different results.

1811
02:31:19,153 --> 02:31:21,698
I think all of them would.

1812
02:31:21,698 --> 02:31:25,118
I've been asked if you'd even
recognize your Injuns by now.

1813
02:31:25,118 --> 02:31:26,286
I think I might.

1814
02:31:28,329 --> 02:31:29,455
What does that mean?

1815
02:31:31,374 --> 02:31:36,713
I mean finding Injuns, Elias,
that's not your problem.

1816
02:31:36,713 --> 02:31:39,674
I'm just asking if it's all
important they be yours?

1817
02:31:41,634 --> 02:31:42,593
No.

1818
02:31:46,639 --> 02:31:47,598
It's not.

1819
02:31:56,691 --> 02:31:59,110
Well, as soon as
you all get over

1820
02:31:59,110 --> 02:32:00,987
being particular about that,

1821
02:32:00,987 --> 02:32:03,448
well, by God, I can show you
five settlements

1822
02:32:03,448 --> 02:32:05,033
like I can show you
five fingers.

1823
02:32:07,285 --> 02:32:08,953
And if they didn't
burn your town...

1824
02:32:10,747 --> 02:32:13,333
well, they did just as bad
or they will.

1825
02:32:15,877 --> 02:32:18,254
We'll need our own Injuns too.

1826
02:32:18,254 --> 02:32:20,089
They're easier.
We just buy them.

1827
02:32:21,424 --> 02:32:22,467
Buy 'em with what?

1828
02:32:24,052 --> 02:32:26,137
Well, I see all these
cartridges you saved

1829
02:32:26,137 --> 02:32:28,890
by not shooting at anything.

1830
02:32:28,890 --> 02:32:31,684
I don't have to tell you
how crazy Injuns are for them.

1831
02:32:31,684 --> 02:32:34,687
Hell, a Mescalero will
track his own mother for one.

1832
02:32:34,687 --> 02:32:36,397
Box of bullets out here
will buy you

1833
02:32:36,397 --> 02:32:38,816
a whole goddamn Injun army,
I know that for a fact.

1834
02:32:40,818 --> 02:32:43,112
Well, I'm not saying
that you...

1835
02:32:43,112 --> 02:32:46,741
have to give up this idea of
finding your White Mountains.

1836
02:32:49,160 --> 02:32:51,245
I'm just saying you could make
a living at this

1837
02:32:51,245 --> 02:32:52,372
while you're at it.

1838
02:32:53,790 --> 02:32:54,999
Keep you sharp.

1839
02:33:25,655 --> 02:33:27,990
No, no. Oh gosh. No.

1840
02:33:31,411 --> 02:33:34,330
Oh no. Let me see. Let me see.

1841
02:33:35,706 --> 02:33:38,459
It's fine. It's fine.

1842
02:33:38,459 --> 02:33:39,627
Come on.

1843
02:34:00,731 --> 02:34:01,524
Nah.

1844
02:34:06,612 --> 02:34:08,614
- Oh God.
- Shh.

1845
02:34:08,614 --> 02:34:10,241
I'm putting you to sleep.

1846
02:34:13,077 --> 02:34:14,996
We're gonna wake
that child, Mary.

1847
02:34:23,588 --> 02:34:26,132
Really, I'm... I'm about...

1848
02:34:27,258 --> 02:34:28,468
I'm about used up.

1849
02:34:28,468 --> 02:34:30,887
Not all the way, you're not.

1850
02:34:30,887 --> 02:34:32,263
You just lay there.

1851
02:35:30,488 --> 02:35:31,906
"His name is Samson.

1852
02:35:33,115 --> 02:35:35,034
Or shorter for Sam.

1853
02:35:35,034 --> 02:35:37,411
His parents are dead.

1854
02:35:37,411 --> 02:35:38,788
Please care for him."

1855
02:37:08,753 --> 02:37:11,380
Lieutenant.

1856
02:37:11,380 --> 02:37:14,342
I'm sorry. I'm just, um...
I need a minute.

1857
02:37:14,342 --> 02:37:16,594
- With me?
- Mm.

1858
02:37:16,594 --> 02:37:17,887
Well, I hope
it's something good.

1859
02:37:17,887 --> 02:37:19,639
You just scared off
all my help.

1860
02:37:19,639 --> 02:37:22,183
Yeah, I'll get them back.

1861
02:37:22,183 --> 02:37:25,561
You know, I don't usually deal
in the gossip of the camp.

1862
02:37:25,561 --> 02:37:27,897
But I guess
there's been some...

1863
02:37:27,897 --> 02:37:31,442
speculation from
some of them

1864
02:37:31,442 --> 02:37:32,902
about you and me.

1865
02:37:32,902 --> 02:37:34,904
And I apologize if you've
heard any of that,

1866
02:37:34,904 --> 02:37:36,989
and I don't want you to
think I'm a part of it.

1867
02:37:36,989 --> 02:37:39,784
- No, I didn't.
- And I don't...

1868
02:37:39,784 --> 02:37:42,828
I hope, ma'am,
that my behavior...

1869
02:37:42,828 --> 02:37:44,664
I haven't...

1870
02:37:44,664 --> 02:37:46,207
encouraged any feelings in you

1871
02:37:46,207 --> 02:37:48,626
that I couldn't possibly
entertain, myself.

1872
02:37:51,420 --> 02:37:54,340
So, it would be in light
of your being married?

1873
02:37:59,053 --> 02:38:00,388
Now, if any of this has come

1874
02:38:00,388 --> 02:38:03,724
from my friend Mr. Chavez,
then, uh...

1875
02:38:03,724 --> 02:38:07,770
you should understand
he likes to play
in my affairs

1876
02:38:07,770 --> 02:38:10,064
with the idea
that he's helping me.

1877
02:38:10,064 --> 02:38:11,524
Maybe he's seen some chance

1878
02:38:11,524 --> 02:38:12,942
that you might
be happy, that's all.

1879
02:38:12,942 --> 02:38:14,735
And he doesn't see
any old-fashioned reason

1880
02:38:14,735 --> 02:38:15,945
why you shouldn't be.

1881
02:38:17,613 --> 02:38:18,572
Neither do I.

1882
02:38:22,576 --> 02:38:25,204
You know, I won't presume
anything about you,

1883
02:38:25,204 --> 02:38:27,665
but whatever it is
you've rehearsed to say to me,

1884
02:38:27,665 --> 02:38:30,042
I think you've said it.

1885
02:38:30,042 --> 02:38:32,503
Strictly, there's no reason
for you to stay here.

1886
02:38:34,422 --> 02:38:35,715
And here you are.

1887
02:38:44,974 --> 02:38:46,809
You don't need to worry
about your behavior

1888
02:38:46,809 --> 02:38:48,894
around me, Mr. Gephart.

1889
02:38:48,894 --> 02:38:52,565
So far, you have been
the soul of honor.

1890
02:38:52,565 --> 02:38:55,901
Really, I've been wondering
when you'll stop.

1891
02:39:53,250 --> 02:39:54,376
Whose is that?

1892
02:40:01,342 --> 02:40:02,676
Russell, whose is that?

1893
02:40:10,559 --> 02:40:11,352
His.

1894
02:40:12,561 --> 02:40:14,063
I swear to you I tied it.

1895
02:40:34,625 --> 02:40:35,668
Oh, God.

1896
02:40:43,592 --> 02:40:45,386
What are you doing?

1897
02:40:45,386 --> 02:40:47,221
You're too far.

1898
02:40:53,352 --> 02:40:55,604
Well, this looks damn unhealthy.

1899
02:40:55,604 --> 02:40:57,273
Tarak!

1900
02:41:09,285 --> 02:41:10,369
Tarak!

1901
02:41:10,369 --> 02:41:11,495
All right.

1902
02:41:14,081 --> 02:41:16,250
This might not be up to us,
after all.

1903
02:41:17,251 --> 02:41:18,836
When we start this thing,

1904
02:41:18,836 --> 02:41:21,505
you take this up there
and look out over the river,

1905
02:41:21,505 --> 02:41:23,048
against anything coming back.

1906
02:41:27,595 --> 02:41:29,513
You plan on carrying that
whole rig up there with ya?

1907
02:41:31,932 --> 02:41:33,893
Well, all right.

1908
02:41:33,893 --> 02:41:35,769
Maybe you'll have better luck
with it this time.

1909
02:41:46,363 --> 02:41:47,323
How far now?

1910
02:41:54,622 --> 02:41:55,831
He says the wind's with us,

1911
02:41:55,831 --> 02:41:57,416
but they might still hear.

1912
02:42:40,709 --> 02:42:42,252
Oh, no. Don't do that.

1913
02:42:53,931 --> 02:42:55,516
Boss.

1914
02:42:55,516 --> 02:42:56,809
Huh?

1915
02:43:18,372 --> 02:43:19,540
When I say...

1916
02:45:02,851 --> 02:45:03,769
Russell!

1917
02:45:06,563 --> 02:45:07,648
Russell!

1918
02:45:12,277 --> 02:45:13,570
We still all right?

1919
02:46:30,480 --> 02:46:32,191
You're watching the river!

1920
02:47:29,248 --> 02:47:32,793
All right, we better move
before this gets complicated.

1921
02:47:36,296 --> 02:47:38,090
Didn't think it'd be so easy.

1922
02:47:38,090 --> 02:47:39,633
Yeah, what do you think now?

1923
02:47:43,053 --> 02:47:43,845
Hey, Russell!

1924
02:47:45,639 --> 02:47:46,848
Come on!

1925
02:47:46,848 --> 02:47:48,100
We done here.
